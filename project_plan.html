									<h3 class="major">Topic</h3>

									<h3 class="major">Motivation</h3>
									<p>
										Meme-team’s motivation behind the Mimi-box stems from the
										type of product that it is, a “Social game”. During the
										COVID-19 lockdowns each member of Meme-team was impacted in
										different and various ways, but similarly, team members were
										unable to travel out of state to visit family and friends,
										even some unable to travel past 5km. An overall lack of
										social life sparked the motivation behind this project,
										social games should be encouraging and inclusive with small
										chances to leave someone out of the fun, you can see this
										idea in the gameplay design, interactions and physical
										device of the Mimi-box. Meme-team wanted to create a product
										that would be used multiple times, making friends, family,
										and even strangers laugh. Furthermore, working on this
										project allows Meme-team members to appeal to future
										employers with their ability to put together an IT product
										showcasing multiple skill’s clearly by the very design
										itself. Borrowing from 3D printing, user design, 3D
										modelling, hardware design, programming, gameplay
										engineering, audio engineering and additionally business.

									<h2 class="major">Detailed Description<h2>

									<h3 class="major">Aims</h3>
									<p>
										The Mimi-box Project’s aim is to create a handheld voice
										operated party game product which will be adopted by
										retailers to sell on their shelves. The meme team plan on
										achieving this by creating a prototype device and final
										product specifications document to appeal to investors for
										budgeting and manufacturing. The process involves these set
										goals: creating the base mock-up program code, creating a 3D
										model of the Mimi-box, and prototype hardware sourcing.
										Thereafter creating the script and voice recordings of
										Mimi-box interactions, 3D printing and refining the 3D model
										exterior and interior ready to be presented, testing the
										prototype with users from ages 12 to young adult<a
										href="#aims_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>. Using the test results
										and market research, along with materials, final product
										hardware, and projected manufacturing costs to create the
										specification document to obtain funding for the fruition of
										the shelf ready product, sourcing efficient cost-effective
										manufacturing through the investors partnership.
									</p>

									<h4>
										Mock-up programming code for demonstration and testing
									</h4>
									<p>
										The prototype will be made for testing, to the end user it
										will essentially be the same as the final product. The
										programming involved in creating the prototype isn’t overly
										complex, Steve Holman of meme-team using his experience in
										Java programming will write the mock-up program while
										holding plans to create the final product with python. When
										aiming for a prototype, functionality can be reduced to save
										time, focusing on hardware connectivity, voice input and
										output, voice comparison, difficulty levels, usability and
										gameplay flow.
									</p>

									<h4>
										3D model object representation of the Mimi-box
									</h4>
									<p>
										The Mimi-box is shaped similar to a skewed and stretched
										hexagonal prism, it’s designed to contain four buttons,
										microphone and speaker gausses, and a batter pack slot. We
										are able to create a 3D model prototype of the Mimi-box to
										match hardware dimensions and design changes, this 3D model
										is easy to update as the Mimi-box is a simple design. These
										3D model changes are likely to occur as we fit the hardware,
										wiring, waterproofing and shock absorption parts into the
										interior of the prototype, using 3D modelling technology to
										save costs on assembling physical components per each
										updated prototype.
									</p>

									<h4>
										Hardware sourcing for prototype
									</h4>
									<p>
										The speaker and microphone of the Mimi-box will be selected
										for their quality, lifespan, and bulk purchase availability.
										As the Mimi-box is essentially a spoken game, sound input
										and output are very important and need to be a focus of the
										project hardware, furthermore, speakers and microphones used
										for the prototype will continue through to the final
										product. The prototype will take advantage of a Raspberry Pi
										3B while the final product will require a custom PCB
										(printed circuit board)<a href="#aims_1"><sup>[2]</sup></a>
										to vastly reduce costs, while finding an easy manufactured
										connection method between the hardware. Lastly the power
										source for the final product should be easily managed by the
										user and keep a decent battery charge lifespan<a
										href="#aims_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>, while simple button
										inputs on cords are used for Mimi-box user functionality.
									</p>

									<h4>
										Script & Voice Recording for interactions between the
										Mimi-box and the players
									</h4>
									<p>
										The main interaction between the users and the game are
										taken via one button and vocal interaction, Meme team are
										aiming to create an affinity through these interactions and
										an entertaining inclusive script. The script is to be built
										to guide users in gameplay, supply examples or lead users in
										their thinking, control the flow of the game and game modes,
										and hype up users creating a fun and straightforward user
										experience through the Mimi-box’s vocal interactions.
									</p>

									<h4>
										3D printed Mimi-box
									</h4>
									<p>
										3D printing the Mimi-box prototype using the 3D object
										designed for the hardware specifications and adding rubber
										for shock absorption and feet to stand the product. Buttons
										to be printed separately and slotted into place inside the
										box, in front of the corded button input hardware.
									</p>

									<h4>
										Testing the prototype and collecting data for investors
									</h4>
									<p>
										The completed prototype of the Mimi-box will be tested with
										various demographics of users ranging from families to
										groups of 12 years-old’s up to young adults<a
										href="#aims_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>. The data collected from
										this testing is to be placed into a spreadsheet and
										represented alongside market research, giving Meme team the
										opportunity to receive an investment or funding that will
										allow Mimi-box to progress towards manufacturing.

									<h3 class="major">Plans and Progress</h3>

									<h3 class="major">Roles</h3>

									<h3 class="major">Scope and Limits</h3>

									<p>
										The scope of the project is relative to the considered
										finalization stage based off time restraints given as well
										individual commitments that may impede progress of the final
										outcome. Given the current assignment deadline as it stands,
										we have a prototype of our entertainment system that presents
										the functionality of recording raw audio inputs and said input
										recorded logged as an actively saved sound file. Along with
										this is a 3rd dimensional digital visual representation as
										designs for the product, as well place holder for a voice over
										for the game.
									</p>
									<p>
										As the scope for a whole development cycle is unfeasible give
										our current restrictions it would be appropriate to assume
										that the game loop the system requires for basic function may
										not be presentable and delivered in segments as
										aforementioned.
									</p>
									<p>
										These would pertain to the basic game functions such as taking
										the audio and saving it as a file but will not be yet able to
										compare these audio files accurately or to an acquitted
										standard of function that a final output would need, as well
										as deliverable or a real-world demonstration of our final
										product would be un-producible. Although, many examples of
										code and hardware needed to function have been explored by
										multiple members of the Meme Team with drawn and computer
										drawn designs as well as working on a Raspberry Pi that is
										recording audio input which can be seen in the protect
										testing. Extensive research has also been put towards the
										absent necessity through the subset tasks proposed by the Mimi
										Box although this achievement may be unobtainable due to the
										hypothetical global appeal of the device and vigorous testing
										that is implied by a global scale production line that is also
										mentioned in the testing section, an example that could be
										given upon the long term that would not happen without backing
										from a company or entrepreneur.
									</p>
									<p>
										As the game is sound based it wouldn't be illogical to draw
										comparison towards Sony Entertainments Sing-Star<a
										href="#scope_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> in which you try to imitate
										famous singers in iconic songs and although on January 31,
										2020 the company shut down, the proportions of the company
										speak for themselves and in the case of long-term development
										would see them as a milestone competitor "Sing-Star series has
										now sold over 20 million units, Sony has announced....
										confirmed 16 million units had been sold across PAL regions
										alone"<a href="#scope_2"><sup>[2]</a>. This connects back to
										the global variation required by the testing and a final
										production line and would be considered way beyond the scope
										of current circumstances.

									<h3 class="major">Tools and Technologies</h3>

									<p>
										When producing the Mimi Box, a standalone entertainment
										system, the two aspects to consider are the hardware in use
										and the software, as well as two subset factors which are the
										developmental prototype and then the final device. The primary
										board for prototyping will be a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B Plus
										<a href="#tools_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> to pertain a relatively accurate representation of size
										and power delivery, due to its "tiny credit card size... Just
										add a keyboard, mouse, display, power supply, micro SD card
										with installed Linux"<a href="#tools_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>, which as stated, uses the Linux
										operating system variant Raspbian specifically built for the
										Pi. This would be ideal due to its distinct flexibility for
										software development availability, testing comparison and to
										transition the development to the final product in the event
										of crunch time.
									</p>

									<p>
										The final product itself would be a custom-built PCB with
										inbuilt required hardware such as speakers, microphone and a
										battery kit that would be mounted individually upon the PCB,
										the prototype will require external attachments as
										placeholders for the mounted peripherals. Our chosen
										microphone for the prototype is a ‘SunFounder USB 2.0
										Mini’<a href="#tools_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>, primarily due to it’s convenient size and
										compatibility with the chosen board during development and is
										also the idea that was followed when selecting the battery
										pack ‘MintyBoost Kit - v3.0’<a href="#tools_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>. The Speaker although was more
										aesthetically pleasing ‘Speaker pHAT’<a href="#tools_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> while still
										maintaining size and power efficiency but aiming for a retro
										style that fits the protects target appeal of returning to
										home gaming, interpersonal interactions and away from online.
									</p>

									<p>
										The software during the development and the final product
										differ, likewise to the hardware as in current development on
										the Raspberry Pi 3 B Plus is using Java<a href="#tools_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> (Java Development
										Kit 14<a href="#tools_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> and onto 15 depending on development period) and
										this will be translated into Python (version 3.9) towards the
										end of the production to reduce the complexity of the library
										and functions called to the specific requirements of our
										construed game modes during later program development. Beyond
										that, the plan is to then have the custom PCB built to the
										requirements of the program specs rather than limiting the
										function of the game based on hardware constraints when
										producing a final product.

									<h3 class="major">Testing</h3>
									<p>
										From Multiple aspects it would be difficult to declare when
										the Mimi box is a finished product as many innovations could
										be made in series of updates or version releases. And that
										would propose various expansions upon the available game modes
										& or similar variations of the way the player must mimic their
										opponent such as facial expressions,
									</p>
									<p>
										In the case for the basis of a prototype the first version of
										the Mimi box that would be considered a final product, this
										would most likely entail the base primes of having players be
										capable of comparing their voice recording to set a
										score-based system this would be the most accurate
										demonstration of the product the Meme Team intends.
									</p>
									<p>
										Yet due to time confinements, having a real-world design and
										functional program would be the most feasible. Below are
										examples such as 3D Model, code examples toward what a
										functional version of our device would require as well as
										example audio output from the product.
									</p>
									<p>
										Furthermore, there are multiple aspects that would benefit
										from quality assurance. The most prevalent to mind is the
										accuracy of compared matrix of the recorded MEL frequencies
										which would directly determine the scale and skill ceiling,
										this is only trial and error as the game must be within a
										degree of accuracy that isn't so low the game requires no
										skill and on the opposite end not too accurate as to be
										unplayable. This would also include quality assuring the
										physical durability of the hardware encasement to upfront
										deliver to our target audience which would require a broad
										demographic with diverse dialect to ensure that language
										variants of the product are quality assured.
									</p>
									<p>
										This would include most if not all available nationality's to
										test as well as any age groups as vocal intonation varies due
										to puberty as well “Linguistic variation, Sociolinguistic
										Variation, Dialectal Variation and Linguistic Variables”<a
										href="#testing_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> which comes back to the
										IPA<a href="#testing_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> (International
										phonetic alphabet) and regional to language variation which
										would be an example of how our Mimi box fulfils its role as a
										versatile in-home entertainment device.

									<h3 class="major">Timeframe</h3>

									<h2 class="major">Risks</h3>
									<p>
										Development of the Mimi box as an idea was more complex than
										originally thought as considering the manor of implementation
										to basic components such as power source and code format where
										reconsidered through the process.
									</p>
									<p>
										A primary concern of the entertainment device is the power
										consumption and therefore resulting game play time with our
										prototype this issue arose in which multiple options are
										viable but "All products covered by energy efficiency
										regulations must meet certain requirements before they can be
										supplied or sold in Australia or New Zealand.". This makes it
										so we must comply to a standard of modern efficiency prior to
										convenience which could dramatically impact the product output
										if prototype power consumption relative to final product power
										usage differ significantly.
									</p>
									<p>
										Furthermore, the software as it is currently is recording
										inputs from raw Hz into .Wav files, which can be seen in the
										project testing section, is a great step in the correct
										direction. Beyond this, comparing the files and having a
										score-based system set around said comparisons to be the end
										goal as a functioning game mode which may be easier with
										Python, rather than java, the latter being the one the team
										has chosen for the prototyping phase which could cause minor
										disparagement in how code will function in the final product.
										It is a delicate risk due to the amount of variation the game
										itself must entail to be a global product that will need
										vigorous quality assurance for various dialects which could be
										problematic due to production time constraints, again leading
										toward an unfavourable unit quality on launch simply due to
										the large amount of variation that "differences between the
										speech of men and women, different social classes, and
										differences between age groups.
									</p>
									<p>
										People will identify some of these features as marking the
										"best" or most "beautiful" form of the language, other
										features will be considered nonstandard or undesirable", a
										consideration that would have to be taken by region as the
										product is sound orientated and the inherent functional
										quality as well as sale output  This would be riskily
										undertaken the less testing given a particular language or
										dialect variation and a considerable aspect to assess at a
										case by case basis as to reduce the impact on our Mimi's key
										trait of broad appeal and its most fragile asset.
									</p>
									<p>
										In terms of hardware the casing would be majority of "
										Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, more commonly known as ABS
										plastic. It is relatively inexpensive and lightweight, with a
										density of 1.08 grams per cubic centimetre" for sustained
										durability and cost efficiency which in itself brings a
										cooling risk based on ambient temperature and runtime. The
										manor of power implementation will vary the way in which we
										will have the batteries or power cable be connected and
										protected which we would require an airtight seal or case
										cover on the exterior to make the product more waterproof.
										Although, that would raise the risk for temperature and device
										handling limitations and should have terms and conditions to
										the situation where hardware or software insufficiency are in
										the fault of design, manufacture or user actions and would be
										assessed through testing. It may require fail safe measures
										like seen in the original Xbox 360's red ring of death which
										displayed the type of fault and severity of damage by the
										number and placement of red bars in the ring. Something like
										this for various functional issues would reduce risk to
										company image and allow us to offer repair or a supplementary
										service in return for product fault on our behalf, delicate
										implementation of insurance cover and user warranty to
										compensate for inevitable faults at any level of production or
										consumer use.
