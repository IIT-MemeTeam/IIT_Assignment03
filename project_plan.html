									<h3 class="major">Overview</h3>
									<p>
										The Mimi-box is a ‘party friendly’ casual party game with game design focused on
										user interactivity through voice input. This ‘fun for all ages’ game device has
										the players speak to the box to try and imitate their fellow players voice
										playback, it then scores the players based on how closely they have mimicked
										their fellow player all within given turn-based rule sets and game modes, points
										are awarded for most modes so players will try their best to be the top mimic
										each round. The Mimi-box also utilises pre-recorded pre-stored voice lines from
										a ‘game host’ that will guide players and interchange between various situations
										to maintain entertainment. This game encourages spontaneity and creativity of
										player’s using their voice while utilizing accents, tongue twisters and any
										assortment of sounds the player can muster to throw the opponent off, with the
										primary intention of inducing unique, ridiculous game play with high replay
										ability.
									</p>

									<h3 class="major">Motivation</h3>
									<p>
										The motivation behind the gameplay aspects and decisions
										made into the design of the Mimi-box are inspired by the
										normalization of household party games during the COVID-19
										pandemic. We want family and friends to have a new
										interactive form of entertainment to enjoy due to the given
										circumstances that Australia and the rest of the world is
										in.
									</p>
									<p>
										At the current time with "Social distancing" in place
										throughout Australia, people have been unable to meet each
										other, let alone interact in forms of entertainment outside
										of online media, gaming, or movies. From the 2006 study that
										showed "the average 15 to 34-year-olds spends just under 3
										hours with friends and 10 hours with their family each
										weekend" we have simple statistics we can draw upon along
										with the given situation of COVID-19 that brings our project
										a clear aim, to facilitate the popularity of interactive
										party games, fulfilling the human need for social
										interaction. The Mimi-box is all inclusive, with voice
										recognition technology not requiring accurate pronunciation
										(or even the same language), having a low base skill level
										requirement, and the game design encouraging fast paced
										interactions in social groups. Therefore, the Mimi-box
										project will be able to fulfill these aforementioned social
										interaction needs and become a game product people can use
										to feel closer together.
									</p>

									<h3 class="major">Description</h3>
									<p>
										The concept for a basic run of the game doesn’t involve too
										much, after starting the game with 2 or more players, the
										first user will input the number of players and then record
										a sound / message when prompted by the Mimi-box. Prior to
										the first input, each of the players will need to input
										their name so each user input can be identified. When ready
										the player can press 'speak', this button will allow the
										user to record their input to be stored by the Mimi-box,
										then pressing skip will start the game which will first
										instruct the player of how the game works, with the emphasis
										on recording a voice that is difficult for other players to
										repeat. After which the next and or all player/s will
										attempt to imitate what the first player sounded like and
										the individual with the highest accuracy will be considered
										the winner of the game/ round.
									</p>
									<p>
										A secondary game mode of the box called funny mode will pull
										from a pre-stored library of sound effects and sentences,
										which when played-back asks the players to imitate the sound
										collectively in turn, whomever is the closest wins said
										round, or moves on without elimination. These voice recorded
										inputs by players will have a timer to have the inputs be
										properly comparable, this means you as a player are on the
										clock to provide your statement, joke or accented sentence
										or whatever the player is capable of choosing within the
										frame of ten seconds.
									</p>
									<p>
										The physical device is a raspberry pi that utilizes java and
										frontier series to compare the MEL-Frequency spectrum of a
										user input determined by contrasting the difference in
										frequency/ pitch between the inputs which will determine the
										most efficient match. This is how a given winner of a set
										game of Mimi-Box is decided, without any player input the
										game will pause and using the skip button is how to have the
										game continue between turns.
									</p>
									<img class="center" src="images/mimi-box.png" alt="The Mimi-box and it's components" style="width:100%;max-width:800px">
									<p style="text-align:center; font-size:0.75em">The Mimi-box and it's components</p>
									<br>
									<p>
										The physical design of the box is a 10cm x 10 cm case that
										closely resembles a hexagonal prism that can be seen (as
										seen above, holds the interior mechanisms audio and power
										within
										the casing with the boxes centre of mass being focused
										around the base, the device itself is generally expected to
										be utilized by children and or youth or perhaps adults that
										are inebriated, therefore, the device needs to be shock
										absorbent and liquid resistant to reduce direct damage to
										the functional hardware. The powering of the device will
										require 6xAA batteries that are found underneath the device
										in a screw bound compartment, the box has majority of its
										user inputs taken on the faces at the top of the case
										consisting of five buttons, one button for ‘power’,  two
										buttons for ‘volume’(up/down) control, a button for ‘skip’
										which also acts as a user’s continue button located on one
										side, while on the other side hosts the last button ‘speak’.
										Under the speak button and behind the case there are small
										grated holes, when the speak button is held the microphone
										behind the grated holes will record clear and concise audio
										inputs, and on the top an output speaker for the device to
										communicate the directions and next instruction.
									</p>

									<h3 class="major">Tools and Technology</h3>
									<p>
										The technology at hand is a Raspberry Pi Zero set up to run
										the game through a java code program. That program will take
										the users voice inputs as a measurement in Hz, then make an
										excerpt of the given audio signal from this user's voice
										input, then the users input, and take the frontier transform
										(a composition of a signal over time given as a function
										that is subsequently broken into its constituent expressions
										of frequencies). From there you have to map the powers of
										given powers in correlation to the Mel spectrum specifically
										utilizing Triangular overlapping windows which provides the
										pitch of the speech given decibels/ amplitude of a
										dictation.
									</p>
									<p>
										This can be used to compare the users pitch of input, to do
										as said the program needs to take the log of the each of the
										recorded Mel frequency's, there after performing a discrete
										cosine transform with the list of Mel frequency logged
										powers.
									</p>
									<p>
										That has become the resulting signal that the other players
										are intending to match with, this is a MFCC's, in order to
										have the box perform a comparison it will be necessary to
										compare each of the recorded Mel frequency's as matrices
										with identical vector signal size. Hence 10 seconds each is
										chosen to be consistent per turn to have each matrix line up
										for this comparison more dynamically for the Frontier
										transformations, where taking the two inputs as A & B and
										the proposed distance between them being C which would
										function as (CxA)= X and (CxB) =Y ,(X/Y) = the distance
										between the two frequency MFCC's. This is called speaker
										adaptation, notably the first coefficient provided by the
										MFCC is an expression of loudness and should be disregarded
										when the intention of the device is the comparison of
										utterances.
									</p>

									<p>
										The physical components of the case that are found primarily
										within the box are a Adafruit 12S MEMS Microphone for sound
										input as well an mini HAT, the Adafruit 12S 3W Stereo
										Speaker Bonnet mini Kit, using 12S digital sound to create
										clear crisp audio, with the intention of efficiency and
										Saving power, the Mimi-box uses 1 mono 40mm diameter 4 Ohm
										3-watt speaker. The power is provided by a 6xAA battery pack
										connected via a universal battery eliminator circuit that is
										within the aforementioned bottom skew compartment for ease
										of battery change and safe use.
									</p>

									<h3 class="major">Skills Required</h3>
									<p>
										Given the Raspberry Pi is Linux base operating software,
										this particular case will need to install and set-up the
										device to be running java using Open-JDK as this is one of
										the most efficient ways to achieve development of variable
										loops and comparisons. Furthermore, this program requires
										methods to be called by taking inputs of the user as a
										discrete function which can then be compared against each
										other, we do this comparison to determine the winner of a
										round or game. After this, we instigate various while loops
										as well as actively declare the user’s inputs as variables
										that can be correlated to integer values to then be
										evaluated and compared based on intensity/ amplitude to see
										how accurate the repeat of a given sequence is. With that in
										mind array values will need to temporarily store the
										variables of the inputs we are matching and the recordings
										that are being compared against within a margin of error and
										loop back turn by turn.
									</p>
									<p>
										The hardware challenges require the Mimi-box to have the
										microphone, pins and heads of each component individually
										soldered to the raspberry Pi. Thankfully the components
										themselves can be purchased from Adafruit and Pi hardware as
										an available direct bulk purchase and distribution batches,
										yet individual assembly is still required per unit
										production as well as development and implementation of java
										code to function for the game. This can be implemented in
										FFT to capture the input and have an active and a copy as to
										store one array, then to compare each active player against
										the first input and log each player’s score to display at
										the end of a round/game.
									</p>

									<h3 class="major">Outcome</h3>
									<p>
										Our projects intended proposed idea is a feasible and fun
										game for friends or family to enjoy on a causal basis.
										Mimi-box is intentionally creating gameplay that fulfills
										the social needs of the individual with the game design
										choice that invites inclusivity. It is designed to expand
										upon the voice recognition industry under the guides of
										creating an entertainment system that promotes creative
										social interaction as a standard of household party games.
										With a purpose to draw attention to our needs as people in a
										modern society and revitalize the party game category, using
										the innovation of the dynamic raspberry pi and supporting
										hardware and software to present to you the Mimi-Box.
