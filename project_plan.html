								<p>
									Development of the Mimi box as an idea was more complex than
									originally thought as considering the manor of implementation
									to basic components such as power source and code format where
									reconsidered through the process.
								</p>
								<p>
									A primary concern of the entertainment device is the power
									consumption and therefore resulting game play time with our
									prototype this issue arose in which multiple options are
									viable but "All products covered by energy efficiency
									regulations must meet certain requirements before they can be
									supplied or sold in Australia or New Zealand.". This makes it
									so we must comply to a standard of modern efficiency prior to
									convenience which could dramatically impact the product output
									if prototype power consumption relative to final product power
									usage differ significantly.
								</p>
								<p>
									Furthermore, the software as it is currently is recording
									inputs from raw Hz into .Wav files, which can be seen in the
									project testing section, is a great step in the correct
									direction. Beyond this, comparing the files and having a
									score-based system set around said comparisons to be the end
									goal as a functioning game mode which may be easier with
									Python, rather than java, the latter being the one the team
									has chosen for the prototyping phase which could cause minor
									disparagement in how code will function in the final product.
									It is a delicate risk due to the amount of variation the game
									itself must entail to be a global product that will need
									vigorous quality assurance for various dialects which could be
									problematic due to production time constraints, again leading
									toward an unfavourable unit quality on launch simply due to
									the large amount of variation that "differences between the
									speech of men and women, different social classes, and
									differences between age groups.
								</p>
								<p>
									People will identify some of these features as marking the
									"best" or most "beautiful" form of the language, other
									features will be considered nonstandard or undesirable", a
									consideration that would have to be taken by region as the
									product is sound orientated and the inherent functional
									quality as well as sale output  This would be riskily
									undertaken the less testing given a particular language or
									dialect variation and a considerable aspect to assess at a
									case by case basis as to reduce the impact on our Mimi's key
									trait of broad appeal and its most fragile asset.
								</p>
								<p>
									In terms of hardware the casing would be majority of "
									Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, more commonly known as ABS
									plastic. It is relatively inexpensive and lightweight, with a
									density of 1.08 grams per cubic centimetre" for sustained
									durability and cost efficiency which in itself brings a
									cooling risk based on ambient temperature and runtime. The
									manor of power implementation will vary the way in which we
									will have the batteries or power cable be connected and
									protected which we would require an airtight seal or case
									cover on the exterior to make the product more waterproof.
									Although, that would raise the risk for temperature and device
									handling limitations and should have terms and conditions to
									the situation where hardware or software insufficiency are in
									the fault of design, manufacture or user actions and would be
									assessed through testing. It may require fail safe measures
									like seen in the original Xbox 360's red ring of death which
									displayed the type of fault and severity of damage by the
									number and placement of red bars in the ring. Something like
									this for various functional issues would reduce risk to
									company image and allow us to offer repair or a supplementary
									service in return for product fault on our behalf, delicate
									implementation of insurance cover and user warranty to
									compensate for inevitable faults at any level of production or
									consumer use.
