									<h2 class="major">Overview<h2>

									<h3 class="major">Topic</h3>

									<p>
										Meme-teams purpose in this project is to create a physical
										and portable social game named after the function of
										mimicking one another, as the “Mimi-box”. This is a spoken
										game that entices players to speak to it in fun and uniquely
										interesting ways, because the other players will have to
										mimic them! Mimi-box is both the game and the controller
										which is located within a truncated hexagonal prism case
										built perfectly for heavy use in family settings and even
										parties.
									</p>
									<p>
										The Mimi-box will be designed and achieved by Meme-team
										members who aim to bring this game to life for people to
										purchase off of retail shelves across the nation, ultimately
										to become as recognisable as monopoly.
									</p>
									<p>
										Aiming for encouraging inclusivity in new social settings
										and delivering fun gameplay that allows Mimi-box’s players
										to open up, break the ice, and be involved with their peers,
										and even interact with Mimi-box itself as it guides and
										talks with the players. Filling the gap in the market on
										speech focused social games because Meme-team believes that
										everyone has a unique voice and something to say.
									</p>

									<h3 class="major">Motivation</h3>
									<img class="image fit" style="max-width:100%;" src="./images/project/Motivation.jpg" alt="Motivation"></img>

									<p>
										Meme-team’s motivation behind the Mimi-box stems from the
										type of product that it is, a “Social game”. During the
										COVID-19 lockdowns each member of Meme-team was impacted in
										different and various ways, but similarly, team members were
										unable to travel out of state to visit family and friends,
										even some unable to travel past 5km. An overall lack of
										social life sparked the motivation behind this project,
										social games should be encouraging and inclusive with small
										chances to leave someone out of the fun, you can see this
										idea in the gameplay design, interactions and physical
										device of the Mimi-box. Meme-team wanted to create a product
										that would be used multiple times, making friends, family,
										and even strangers laugh. Furthermore, working on this
										project allows Meme-team members to appeal to future
										employers with their ability to put together an IT product
										showcasing multiple skill’s clearly by the very design
										itself. Borrowing from 3D printing, user design, 3D
										modelling, hardware design, programming, gameplay
										engineering, audio engineering and additionally business.
									</p>

									<h3 class="major">Landscape</h3>
									<img class="image fit" style="max-width:100%;" src="./images/project/Landscape.jpg" alt="Landscape"></img>


									<p>
										There have been many games like the Mimi-box that
										incorporate voice recognition, using different algorithms to
										distinguish between pitch, tone, and key vocal notes. These
										include games like the ever-popular SingStar and the
										original Furby, which was insanely ahead of its time as the
										first successfully produced domestically aimed robot. Other
										party types of games that draw from similar playstyle
										concepts include Operation and Lightning Reaction. SingStar
										is probably the most comparable mass-produced product, a
										karaoke video game published by Sony Computer Entertainment
										Europe and released on the PlayStation console platforms <a
										href="#landscape_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>. Unlike the Mimi-Box,
										the SingStar is generally played verse the computer where a
										player is required to sing along with the music to score
										points <a href="#landscape_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>. In
										contrast, the Mimi-Box is more of a head-to-head concept and
										can utilize any form of entertainment input, such as
										singing, reciting poems, sentences, or even just abstract
										sounds and noises.
									</p>
									<p>
										The early generations of Furby's had state of the art voice
										recognition for its time. A newly purchased Furby begins
										speaking in the "Furbish" language before gradually
										replacing Furbish phrases with English over time<a
										href="#landscape_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>. Furby's source code
										was written in ASM language, which was based around a
										Sunplus SPC81A microcontroller and a Texas Instruments
										chipset implementing Linear Predictive Coding, which allowed
										for voice synthesis<a
										href="#landscape_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>. This type of coding
										picks up on certain aspects of the voice, such as the
										Glottis, which is the space between the vocal folds, which
										produces buzz, which is characterized by its loudness and
										frequency, or pitch. This directly correlates to what we
										need to produce for speech synthesis for the Mimi-Box<a
										href="#landscape_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>.
									</p>
									<p>
										While family games such as Lightning Reaction Reloaded and
										Operation don't implement any speech recognition or
										synthesis elements, the turn-based gameplay based around
										multiple players draws similar concepts to the Mimi-Box. The
										Mimi-Box looks to replicate the thrilling, fast-paced action
										that these platforms have.

									<h3 class="major">Aims</h3>
									<img class="image fit" style="max-width:100%;" src="./images/project/Aims.jpg" alt="Aims"></img>

									<p>
										The Mimi-box Project’s aim is to create a handheld voice
										operated party game product which will be adopted by
										retailers to sell on their shelves. The meme team plan on
										achieving this by creating a prototype device and final
										product specifications document to appeal to investors for
										budgeting and manufacturing. The process involves these set
										goals: creating the base mock-up program code, creating a 3D
										model of the Mimi-box, and prototype hardware sourcing.
										Thereafter creating the script and voice recordings of
										Mimi-box interactions, 3D printing and refining the 3D model
										exterior and interior ready to be presented, testing the
										prototype with users from ages 12 to young adult<a
										href="#aims_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>. Using the test results
										and market research, along with materials, final product
										hardware, and projected manufacturing costs to create the
										specification document to obtain funding for the fruition of
										the shelf ready product, sourcing efficient cost-effective
										manufacturing through the investors partnership.
									</p>

									<h4>
										Mock-up programming code for demonstration and testing
									</h4>
									<p>
										The prototype will be made for testing, to the end user it
										will essentially be the same as the final product. The
										programming involved in creating the prototype isn’t overly
										complex, Steven Holman of the Meme team using his experience
										in Java programming will write the mock-up program while
										holding plans to create the final product with python. When
										aiming for a prototype, functionality can be reduced to save
										time, focusing on hardware connectivity, voice input and
										output, voice comparison, difficulty levels, usability and
										gameplay flow.
									</p>

									<h4>
										3D model object representation of the Mimi-box
									</h4>
									<p>
										The Mimi-box is shaped similar to a skewed and stretched
										hexagonal prism, it’s designed to contain five buttons, a
										microphone and speaker gausses, and a battery pack slot. We
										are able to create a 3D model prototype of the Mimi-box to
										match hardware dimensions and design changes, this 3D model
										is easy to update as the Mimi-box is a simple design. These
										3D model changes are likely to occur as we fit the hardware,
										wiring, waterproofing and shock absorption parts into the
										interior of the prototype, using 3D modelling technology to
										save costs on assembling physical components per each
										updated prototype.
									</p>

									<h4>
										Hardware sourcing for prototype
									</h4>
									<p>
										The speaker and microphone of the Mimi-box will be selected
										for their quality, lifespan, and bulk purchase availability.
										As the Mimi-box is essentially a spoken game, sound input
										and output are very important and need to be a focus of the
										project hardware, furthermore, speakers and microphones used
										for the prototype will continue through to the final
										product. The prototype will take advantage of a Raspberry Pi
										3B while the final product will require a custom PCB
										(printed circuit board)<a href="#aims_1"><sup>[2]</sup></a>
										to vastly reduce costs, while finding an easy manufactured
										connection method between the hardware. Lastly the power
										source for the final product should be easily managed by the
										user and keep a decent battery charge lifespan<a
										href="#aims_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>, while simple button
										inputs on cords are used for Mimi-box user functionality.
									</p>

									</figure>

									<h4>
										Script & Voice Recording for interactions between the
										Mimi-box and the players
									</h4>
									<p>
										The main interaction between the users and the game are
										taken via one button and vocal interaction, Meme team are
										aiming to create an affinity through these interactions and
										an entertaining inclusive script. The script is to be built
										to guide users in gameplay, supply examples or lead users in
										their thinking, control the flow of the game and game modes,
										and hype up users creating a fun and straightforward user
										experience through the Mimi-box’s vocal interactions.
									</p>

									<h4>
										3D printed Mimi-box
									</h4>
									<p>
										3D printing the Mimi-box prototype using the 3D object
										designed for the hardware specifications and adding rubber
										for shock absorption and feet to stand the product. Buttons
										to be printed separately and slotted into place inside the
										box, in front of the corded button input hardware.
									</p>

									<h4>
										Testing the prototype and collecting data for investors
									</h4>
									<p>
										The completed prototype of the Mimi-box will be tested with
										various demographics of users ranging from families to
										groups of 12 years-old’s up to young adults<a
										href="#aims_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>. The data collected from
										this testing is to be placed into a spreadsheet and
										represented alongside market research, giving the Meme Team the
										opportunity to receive an investment or funding that will
										allow Mimi-box to progress towards manufacturing.

									<p>
										As a team, we have created significant artifacts towards a
										finished product of the Mimi-Box. From Assignment 1, we had
										different sketches and samples of team member Leonard’s
										representation of the Mimi-Box idea. The illustrations were
										highly detailed and drawn in grey lead pencils on paper,
										with around 2 or 3 hours devoted to completing these. The
										depiction of his sketches began the basis of an objective to
										create in Assignment 3.
									</p>
									<p>
										Research then began in Assignment 2, where we had focused on
										the hardware required for the Mimi-Box. With this groundwork
										complete, we then had a strong understanding of the physical
										components and hardware necessary for building a prototype
										of the Mimi-Box. A Raspberry Pi 3b was the standout choice
										for the prototype’s computer, as it has much support and is
										simple to use when building a model. Assuming we create a
										final product, we would then use a custom-built printed
										circuit board (PCB) to power the Mimi-box. But for now, a
										Raspberry Pi 3b was used, as it is highly compatible with
										both Java and Python coding, the primary languages used
										throughout the creation of this product. The simplicity of
										Java coding was chosen to begin with, which we then used for
										the .wav files to represent the model. Although Java coding
										was used in this instance, if this creation ever does come
										to fruition, we will then shift to Python coding. Python has
										more fluidity, consistency, and stability and works far
										better with a Raspberry Pi. There are also more libraries
										available for Python, which makes programming far more
										practical in this sense.

								</figure>
									<br>
									<p>
										Over the course of Assignment 3, we steadily created a 3d
										model of the Mimi-Box on Blender, which is a free and
										open-source 3D creation program. We took samples from the
										sketches and diagrams of the Mimi-box created in Assignment
										1 and added them in Blender with certain features, colours,
										and styles until the whole team decided on the model to
										develop. Things such as colours and shades of the Mimi-Box
										were frequently changed from silver, black, and white to
										finishing with a gold-ish tone of yellow, which we thought
										stood out in a party setting. Unlike neutral colours, the
										goldish style gives off a fun vibe. We also changed the
										background colour of our 3D creation to a neutral grey.
									</p>
									<p>
										The contrast of the goldish colour on the grey background
										makes the Mimi-Box stand out pleasantly. Using Blender has
										been extremely useful, as we can visualise the Mimi-Box
										design and adjust the design to our liking. Such as adding
										LED lights, buttons, a speaker, and a USB-C port.

									<p>
										As a part of Assignment 5, we created a written script to
										advertise our end-product. To do this, a storyboard of
										scenes was created. The storyboard and script were used by
										the director, and the actors when filming the advertisement.
										The storyboard consists of five different scenes with five
										different representations of what should happen throughout
										these scenes. The initial five sketches are the introduction
										to our advertisement. Scenes 6 - 10 on the storyboard, opens
										with the basis of the Mimi-Box, which includes the types of
										gameplay and different modes. Sections 11 - 15 of the
										storyboard comprises product information regarding the
										Mimi-Box, such as suggested ages, types of batteries
										required, and the type of programming which powers the
										Mimi-Box. 16 – 20 on the storyboard illustrates the
										different occasions and scenarios which the Mimi-Box is
										perfectly suited to, such as breaking the ice at a party or
										being used during family gatherings on various holidays.
										Finally, it finishes with the scenes from 21 - 25, which
										summarise the simplicity, durability, ease of access, and
										fun that the Mimi-Box consists of. With the storyboard
										created, team member Lochlann utilised his three housemates,
										including himself, to film these scenes.

										All these physical artifacts created throughout Assignment
										3, lay the foundations of a design principle with practical

									</p>

									<h4>
										Story of the project
									</h4>
									<p>
										The Mimi-Box project started with an idea brought upon
										during the peak of the COVID-19 Australian lockdowns. In
										this time of heavily restricted social interactions and low
										human interaction, Australians sang out in one accord from
										their animal instinct requirements. They needed some form of
										a social life back. This was the original process of thought
										that lead to the project concept of a social party game;
										humans need to socialise, supply and demand.
									</p>
									<p>
										This basic conceptual idea of a social game came from
										Leonard of the Meme-team. Leonard took the concept of a
										social game and mixed it with his experiences and
										observations from interactions with the strangers he met on
										his travels abroad. He noted; This needed to be a social
										game that anyone can play, mixing strangers and friends
										ranging from all blends of country and cultures, a social
										game that encourages inclusivity, a social game that only
										uses what people already possess; their voice.
									</p>
									<p>
										Leonard decided it would be a social game that uses the
										human voice, recording, comparing, and outputting sound.
										After researching standard DIY hardware to create a graphic
										representation of the device and designing the base gameplay
										concept, the creation of Mimi-Box started. Regardless of
										Leonard’s circumstances that brought the Mimi-Box idea to
										its initial design, Meme-Team had voted to continue working
										on this project where each team member adopted the Mimi-Box
										to push this idea to its fullest potential within their
										capabilities.
									</p>
									<p>
										Originally thought to be a simple concept with a basic
										premise, the Mimi-Box’s development process has not been
										immune to standard development pit holes, but it has also
										seen some great work. One of the key points to any project
										is the aim, the goal, the expected result at the end of the
										deadline, Leonard had written Meme-Teams’ goals and aims
										into a document based on the team discussions. Furthermore,
										creating a timeline of the goal milestones, to be filled out
										and refined as new information and developments come into
										the project, Meme-Team decided that these aims, goals, and
										plans would be defined early in the project but open to
										change as the Mimi-Box takes shape.
									</p>

										<figcaption class="" style="font-size:15px; text-align:center;">Meeting: published on 11/5/20 by Steven Holman - Audio input converted into array of bytes</figcaption>
									</figure>

									<br>
									<p>
										During the early stages of development, it was essential to
										build the core game concept. We needed to know for sure the
										time and effort required for creating the foundation of the
										game program. This is the audio input, audio conversion, and
										the resulting .WAV file to be stored for later playback and
										comparison. With this alone, the Mimi-Box would have its
										testable bare-bones proof of concept ready to be refined
										within the planned timeframe into a complete product. On 5th
										November 2020, the lead programmer Steven of Meme-Team used
										a GitHub branch of the team's repository to upload and host
										the compiled java prototype, on the 6th, Steven added to the
										prototype an observer for Audio output, then on the 7th,
										Steven added file writing. From Steven's hard work, the
										foundation was created speedily, demonstrating early on to
										the other members of Meme-Team an audio input test,
										converting sound into an array of bytes represented as
										comma-separated values.

									</div>

									<p>
										The decision was made to put less work into refining the
										foundation and lend that time to other sections of the
										development, allocating the goal further along in the
										timeframe's timeline to add the use of an FLL library for
										completing the audio comparison mechanic. Steven's skill set
										is unique among the team members. The decision was made to
										spread his department workload into the hypothetical parts
										of the timeframe this way, which offered Steven more diverse
										roles.
									</p>
									<p>
										The next step in the development process was underway,
										Michael and Thomas started researching more in-depth into
										the specific hardware needed. Thomas had previously explored
										and discussed the comparison of audio files and the hardware
										with Steven. They had decided to move away from spectrograms
										towards the much faster version of audio comparison, which,
										as previously stated, uses an FLL library and byte arrays.
										Michael became familiar with the Raspberry Pi series of
										chipboard computers and the necessary hardware. He then
										brought these findings to a group meeting and shared the
										information on the team's page. Tom using the info gathered,
										focused on the risks that could be involved in the hardware
										and device, creating a report. The Mimi-Box's original
										design was taking advantage of the Raspberry Pi Zero for its
										low price and market availability, through discussion and
										the research, Meme-Team made the change from the Raspberry
										Pi Zero to the Raspberry Pi 3B. This was a significant
										increase in price for the prototype yet was easily afforded
										to a hypothetical out of pocket budget as half the team
										members own similar devices. With this change in hardware,
										the prototype no longer represented the hardware that would
										be used for the shelf-ready product, meaning only one
										Raspberry Pi 3B is required for purchase when presenting the
										prototype to future investors.
									</p>
									<p>
										This change was necessary. The Raspberry Pi 3B provides the
										Mimi-Box prototype with the support it requires to represent
										the final product. Creating a priority in the Meme-Teams
										goals when later appealing for investor funding, as now the
										full product will vastly benefit from a custom-built PCB
										with a broader range of tested hardware from the prototype.
										Michael was able to find suitable power source options,
										microphones, and speakers that were not supported on the
										Raspberry Pi Zero. But it can be built into the design of a
										custom PCB—creating a considerable cut in projected
										manufacturing cost, and a boost in ever-important available
										audio options for input/output quality.
									</p>
									<p>
										The biggest struggle that came with solidifying our choices
										in hardware and making hardware changes was regarding
										compatibility. The questions were not only "which battery
										source is plausible for battery life? price? size? and
										availability for customer purchase", but the questions that
										were now more important were also "what volts/amps will the
										Raspberry Pi 3B require? how can we increase battery life
										without affecting the hardware specifications? will this
										cause overheating?".
									</p>
									<p>
										Just as the physical Mimi-Box device's hardware and software
										are essential, the Meme-Team's project cannot succeed
										without clear direction and strategy to enter the market.
										Brent led the team discussion related to competition in the
										marketplace, researching other popular social games using
										the same gameplay aspects and technical ability, he was able
										to define the positions these games take in each household.
										His findings helped refine the aim of the Mimi-Box to a
										demographic target while filling a gap in the market. This
										information was considered as Leonard altered the goals and
										aim, updating them and the previously mentioned final
										product hardware specifications. Hereafter, Brent created an
										advertisement script designed for presenting the Mimi-Box to
										potential investors. Thomas refined this script to create a
										graphic storyboard adding the visual elements that were
										later implemented in filming.
									</p>
									<p>
										With the storyboard and script in tow, Lochlann gathered
										local actors and directed the advertisement's filming,
										communicating with the team on this process. Lochlann was
										able to improvise some scenes to remove/replace the need for
										material and props that weren't available at the due time.
										While filming the advertisement, Lochlann was also without a
										working prototype. To amend the problem that occurred in the
										first takes of the film, where the actors did now know when
										to respond, Lochlann used part of the example gameplay
										script provided by Leonard, to speak as the role of
										Mimi-Box's audio interaction, allowing the correct timing of
										the actor's responses. A feature of the storyboard was the
										Mimi-Box sitting between the actors, lacking a physical
										prototype, Steve had created a 3D object. He rendered a
										video output of this object to be keyed into its planned
										place in the storyboard.

									<p>
										A finer feature of the Mimi-Box object planned within this
										timeframe was the battery compartment opening mechanism. As
										it was unneeded for the video, Steve had changed the battery
										compartment's priority to the button pattern and location.
										Leo worked the example gameplay script into sections to be
										recorded. With an attempt at recording, he found his studio
										microphone to produce low-quality audio and was required to
										improvise using a smartphone with a pop filter made out of a
										sock. The audio was recorded, edited, processed, and chopped
										up. The advertisement video files were shared with Michael
										through Microsoft Teams and GitHub, who spent his time
										editing the footage, voice overlay, backing track, 3D
										object, and text into the advertisement video. When needed,
										Michael would request additional or a reshoot of footage
										from Lochlann and an additional voice-over created by Leo as
										the Mimi-box's prototype voice.
									</p>
									<p>
										Currently, Meme-Team stands: As a team, we have created
										multiple artifacts, functionality, documentation,
										experimentation results, advertisements for investors, a 3D
										model not far off printing, and prototyping code. In terms
										of project development and how the timeline will
										hypothetically continue, the next significant steps will be
										to implement an IFF library, hosting the java program on a
										raspberry pi with connected hardware, creating the interior
										of the 3D model, and 3D printing the model.

									<h3 class="major">Roles</h3>
									<img class="image fit" style="max-width:100%;" src="./images/project/Roles.jpg" alt="Roles"></img>

									<p>
										The work structure surrounding the Mimi-Box is a fundamental
										concept. We have a designated Lead Developer, Steven, the
										most talented programmer in our team. The remaining team
										members pitch in with any necessary coding with the website
										to help Steven's pressure and workload. Other than Steven,
										we have no different real designated roles for our team
										members. This works well for us, as all other team members
										have good all-around skills and knowledge on various other
										aspects of I.T, so we have the advantage of being able to
										assign any task to any team member.
									</p>
									<p>
										In Week 1, Thomas created all the required Assignment 3
										tasks in Microsoft teams. We then delegated each team member
										tasks to spread the assignment's entire workload evenly
										amongst the group. Leonard, Michael, and Lochlann all
										started researching and writing various parts of the
										progress. At the same time, Brent focused on writing a
										script for Assignment 5, the first task.
									</p>
									<p>
										Week 2 was much similar, with Steven studying Python
										libraries, which was required for the Mimi-Box. Brent
										finalised the script for Assignment 5 while also researching
										for an advertisement and demographic of our product. Thomas
										used Brent's written script for Assignment 5 and began
										sketches on a storyboard to be submitted along with the
										script. Michael started to investigate Tools and
										Technologies related to the Mimi-Box. At the same time,
										Leonard created the Timeframe document and developed the
										record for the assigned roles. Lochlann completed his career
										plan and revised and edited everyone else's submitted to
										this point.
									</p>
									<p>
										Week 3 was another research and write week for the team,
										with Brent completing the Landscape part of the project and
										finishing his career plan. Lochlann compared everyone's
										career plans and summarised this in a document that Steven
										transferred to our website. Thomas completed and integrated
										the storyboard with the script, ready for filming, for
										Assignment 5. An urgent team meeting was called to share the
										workload. Leonard took the initiative to delegate some tasks
										to himself, which included the Aim of the project.
									</p>
									<p>
										Due to getting married and going on a short honeymoon, Brent
										was happily granted leave by the rest of his team members
										and missed the majority of Week 4. Lochlann used Week 4 to
										review the draft script that Brent wrote in Week 1 and the
										Storyboard that Thomas drew in preparation for recording the
										advertisement for Assignment 5 in Week 5. Thomas focused on
										completing the Scope and Testing tasks required for
										submission as a part of Assignment 3. Leonard being an
										exceptionally skilled writer, began a written script for the
										Mimi-Box gameplay. Steven focused on developing a prototype
										of the Mimi-Box in Blender, a program for creating and
										designing 3D models.
									</p>
									<p>
										With Week 5 beginning, the Plans and Progress part of the
										assignment still needed to be written, the three most
										substantial writers, Lochlann, Leonard, and Brent, all took
										part in writing this section together as it was a massive
										workload for just an individual. Steven continued working on
										the website associated with the Mimi-Box and making changes
										to team profiles from Assignment 2 to update them with our
										career plans in Assignment 3. With his roommates and his
										camera and recording equipment, Lochlann filmed the scenes
										that were required to submit for Assignment 5. Leonard
										recorded his vocals for the Mimi-Box video advertisement.
										Having a strong background in video editing, Michael turned
										both the scenes Lochlann filmed and vocals Leonard recorded
										into a short advertising piece that to be submitted. Thomas
										used this time to continue editing other written reports
										while also helping Steve with the website's coding.
									</p>
									<p>
										Week 6 was mostly tidying up and finishing off any written
										pieces needing to be submitted. Brent took it upon himself
										to write and summarise this very piece of information
										regarding our team roles. Lochlann reviewed and edited the
										Progress and Plans of the Mimi-Box. At the same time,
										Leonard wrote the Mimi-Box story due to its being his
										invention and the background of why he created this product.
										Being a team player, Thomas pitched in and gave everyone any
										pieces of written information that needed assistance.
									</p>
									<p>
										From Week 6 onwards, due to RMIT granting an extension on
										the due date, as a team, we will all use this time to go
										over all the different categories of Assignment 3 and
										editing and reference checking anything that requires it.
										Steven will transfer all this information over to the
										website, ready for submission. Overall, while our workgroup
										doesn't have any clearly defined roles assigned over the
										whole project, we all have excellent all-around knowledge
										and work ethic to achieve the tasks that need to be
										completed.
									</p>

									<h3 class="major">Scope and Limits</h3>
									<img class="image fit" style="max-width:100%;" src="./images/project/Limits.jpg" alt="Limits"></img>


									<p>
										The project's scope is relative to the considered
										finalization stage based on time restraints given as well
										individual commitments that may impede the progress of the
										outcome. Given the current assignment deadline, as it
										stands, we have a prototype of our entertainment system that
										presents the functionality of recording raw audio inputs and
										said input recorded logged as an actively saved sound file.
										Along with this is a 3rd-dimensional digital visual
										representation as designs for the product and place holder
										for a voice over for the game.
									</p>
									<p>
										As the scope for a whole development cycle is unfeasible,
										give our current restrictions, it would be appropriate to
										assume that the game loop the system requires for basic
										function may not be presentable and delivered in segments as
										aforementioned.
									</p>
									<p>
										These would pertain to the basic game functions such as
										taking the audio and saving it as a file but will not be yet
										able to compare these audio files accurately or to an
										acquitted standard of function that a final output would
										need, as well as deliverable or a real-world demonstration
										of our final product would be un-producible. Although many
										examples of code and hardware needed to function have been
										explored by multiple Meme-Team members withdrawn and
										computer-drawn designs and working on a Raspberry Pi
										recording audio input, which can be seen in the protect
										testing. Extensive research has also been put towards the
										absent necessity through the subset tasks proposed by the
										Mimi-Box. However, this achievement may be unobtainable due
										to the hypothetical global appeal of the device and vigorous
										testing that is implied by a global scale production line
										that is also mentioned in the testing section, an example
										that could be given in the long term that would not happen
										without backing from a company or entrepreneur.
									</p>
									<p>
										As the game is soundly based, it wouldn't be illogical to
										draw a comparison towards Sony Entertainments Sing-Star<a
										href="#scope_2"><sup>[1]</sup></a> in which you try to
										imitate famous singers in iconic songs although, on January
										31, 2020, the company shut down, the proportions of the
										company speak for themselves and in the case of long-term
										development would see them as a milestone competitor
										"Sing-Star series has now sold over 20 million units, Sony
										has announced.... confirmed 16 million units had been sold
										across PAL regions alone"<a
										href="#scope_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>. This connects back to
										the global variation required by the testing and a final
										production line and would be considered way beyond the scope
										of current circumstances.

									<p>
										When producing the Mimi Box, a standalone entertainment
										system, the two aspects to consider are the hardware in use
										and the software and two subset factors, which are the
										developmental prototype and then the final device. The
										primary board for prototyping will be a Raspberry Pi 3 Model
										B Plus<a href="#tools_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> to pertain a
										relatively accurate representation of size and power
										delivery due to its "tiny credit card size... Just add a
										keyboard, mouse, display, power supply, micro SD card with
										installed Linux"<a href="#tools_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>,
										which, as stated, uses the Linux operating system variant
										Raspbian specifically built for the Pi. This would be ideal
										due to its distinct flexibility for software development
										availability, testing comparison, and to transition the
										development to the final product in the event of crunch
										time.
									</p>
									<p>
										The final product itself would be a custom-built PCB with
										inbuilt required hardware such as speakers, microphone, and
										a battery kit that would be mounted individually upon the
										PCB. The prototype will require external attachment
										placeholders for the mounted peripherals. Our chosen
										microphone for the prototype is a 'SunFounder USB 2.0
										Mini'<a href="#tools_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>, primarily due to
										its convenient size and compatibility with the chosen board
										during development. This is also the idea that followed when
										selecting the battery pack 'MintyBoost Kit - v3.0'<a
										href="#tools_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>. Although this speaker
										was more aesthetically pleasing 'Speaker pHAT'<a
										href="#tools_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> while still maintaining
										size and power efficiency but aiming for a retro style that
										fits the protects target appeal of returning to home gaming,
										interpersonal interactions, and away from online.
									</p>
									<p>
										The software during the development and the final product
										differ, likewise to the hardware as in current development
										on the Raspberry Pi 3 B Plus is using Java<a
										href="#tools_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> (Java Development Kit
										14<a href="#tools_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> and onto 15
										depending on development period) and this will be translated
										into Python (version 3.9) towards the end of the production
										to reduce the complexity of the library and functions called
										to the specific requirements of our construed game modes
										during later program development. Beyond that, the plan is
										to have the custom PCB built to the program specs'
										requirements rather than limiting the function of the game
										based on hardware constraints when producing a final
										product.

										It would not be easy to declare when the Mimi box is a
										finished product from multiple aspects as many innovations
										could be made in a series of updates or version releases.
										And that would propose various expansions upon the available
										game modes & or similar variations of the way the player
										must mimic their opponent, such as facial expressions.
									</p>
									<p>
										In the case for the basis of a prototype the first version
										of the Mimi box that would be considered a final product,
										this would most likely entail the base primes of having
										players be capable of comparing their voice recording to set
										a score-based system this would be the most accurate
										demonstration of the product the Meme Team intends.
									</p>
									<p>
										Yet, having a real-world design and functional program would
										be the most feasible due to time confinements. Earlier (In plans and progress) there were
										examples such as the 3D Model, code examples toward what a
										functional version of our device would require, and example
										audio output from the product.
									</p>
									<p>
										Furthermore, multiple aspects would benefit from quality
										assurance. The most prevalent to mind is the accuracy of the
										compared matrix of the recorded MEL frequencies, which would
										directly determine the scale and skill ceiling, this is only
										trial and error as the game must be within a degree of
										accuracy that isn't so low the game requires no skill and on
										the opposite end not too accurate as to be unplayable. This
										would also include quality assuring the physical durability
										of the hardware encasement to upfront deliver to our target
										audience, which would require a broad demographic with
										diverse dialect to ensure those language variants of the
										product are quality assured.
									</p>
									<p>
										This would include most if not all available nationalities
										to test as well as any age groups as vocal intonation varies
										due to puberty as well "Linguistic variation,
										Sociolinguistic Variation, Dialectal Variation, and
										Linguistic Variables"<a href="#testing_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
										which comes back to the IPA<a
										href="#testing_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> (International phonetic
										alphabet) and regional to language variation which would be
										an example of how our Mimi box fulfils its role as a
										versatile in-home entertainment device.

									<h3 class="major">Risks</h3>
									<img class="image fit" style="max-width:100%;" src="./images/project/Risk.jpg" alt="Risk"></img>

									<p>
										The Mimi box development as an idea was more complex than
										originally thought of, considering implementing basic
										components such as the power source and code format were
										often reconsidered throughout the process.
									</p>
									<p>
										A primary concern of the entertainment device is the power
										consumption and therefore resulting in a lack of gameplay
										time with our prototype arose in which multiple options are
										viable but "All products covered by energy efficiency
										regulations must meet certain requirements before they can
										be supplied or sold in Australia or New Zealand."<a
										href="#risks_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>. This makes it so we must
										comply with a standard of modern efficiency before
										convenience, which could dramatically impact the product
										output if prototype power consumption relative to product
										power usage differs significantly.
									</p>
									<p>
										Furthermore, currently, the software is recording inputs
										from raw Hz into .WAV files, which can be seen in the
										project testing section, which is a great step in the
										correct direction. Beyond this, comparing the files and
										having a score-based system set around said comparisons to
										be the end goal as a functioning game mode which may be
										easier with Python, rather than java, the latter being the
										one the team has chosen for the prototyping phase, which
										could cause minor disparagement in how code will function in
										the final product. It is a delicate risk due to the amount
										of variation the game itself must entail to be a global
										product that will need vigorous quality assurance for
										various dialects, which could be problematic due to
										production time constraints, again leading toward an
										unfavourable unit quality on launch simply due to a large
										amount of variation that "differences between the speech of
										men and women, different social classes, and differences
										between age groups. People will identify some of these
										features as marking the ‘best’ or most ‘beautiful’ form of
										the language, other features will be considered nonstandard
										or undesirable,"<a href="#risks_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>.
									</p>
									<p>
										A consideration that would have to be taken by region as the
										product is sound orientated and the inherent functional
										quality as well as sale output. This would be riskily
										undertaken the less testing given a particular language or
										dialect variation and a considerable aspect to assess at a
										case-by-case basis as to reduce the impact on our Mimi's key
										trait of broad appeal and its most fragile asset.
									</p>

									<figure class="right" style="width:35%; padding-left:30px; padding-bottom:20px;">
										<img class="modalImg image fit" onclick="openModal(this);" style="margin-bottom:0; max-width:100%;" src="images/project/Xbox_360_Error_codes.png" alt="Xbox 360 Error codes"></img>
										<figcaption class="" style="font-size:15px; text-align:center;">Xbox 360 Error codes<a href="#risks_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a></figcaption>
									</figure>

									<p>
										In terms of hardware, the casing would be mostly
										"Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, more commonly known as ABS
										plastic. It is relatively inexpensive and lightweight, with
										a density of 1.08 grams per cubic centimetre"<a
										href="#risks_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> for sustained durability
										and cost efficiency, which in itself brings a cooling risk
										based on ambient temperature and runtime. The power
										implementation manor will vary how we will have the
										batteries or power cable connected and protected. We would
										require an airtight seal or case cover on the exterior to
										make the product more waterproof. That would raise the risk
										for temperature and device handling limitations and should
										have terms and conditions to the situation where hardware or
										software insufficiency is in the fault of design,
										manufacture, or user actions and assessed through testing.
										It may require fail-safe measures as seen in the original
										Xbox 360's red ring of death<a
										href="#risks_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>, which displayed the type
										of fault and severity of damage by the number and placement
										of red bars in the ring. Something like this for various
										functional issues would reduce risk to company image and
										allow us to offer repair or a supplementary service in
										return for product fault on our behalf, delicate
										implementation of insurance cover and user warranty to
										compensate for inevitable faults at any level of production
										or consumer use.

										Meme-Team is expected to have a meeting at least twice a
										week. The two days in the week which are decided are Sunday
										at 4 pm AEDT and Wednesday at noon AEDT. If a team member
										cannot attend one or more of these meetings, it is expected
										of them to notify the group at least one day in advance. In
										order for no team members to miss what was said in the
										meetings, they are to be recorded and the minutes written
										down. Meme-Team primarily communicates through different
										social media; both Microsoft Teams and Discord are used to
										communicate. Teams is to be used for more professional
										conversations and meetings, while Discord is to be used for
										more casual discussions regarding the project.
									</p>
									<p>
										If a team member is not able to complete tasks due to
										personal reasons, the other team members will pick up where
										they left off, until they can come back to complete their
										task. However, everybody in Meme-Team produces quality work
										and picks up tasks to make up for the loss of time.
