The ‘Meme Team’s Brent Kimm’s ideal job is in application development using the open-source mobile application framework ‘React Native’ as a .NET developer. This Ideal Job overlaps with team member Steve Holman who has experience in .NET programming, While Brent will require JavaScript and JAVA, Steve has purposefully focused on Microsoft C# and Git. These ‘Meme Team’ team members have similar ideal jobs titles with varying skill requirements, in a similar situation to Thomas Lewis and Leonard McDonald who are both aiming for test analyst. With Thomas focusing on metagames system programmer and Leonard with the goal of gameplay engineer, the differences between these job roles are minute but not to be ignored as Thomas’ role is closer to unambiguity and Leonard leans towards a project management skillset. While these members focus on software and game systems, Michael Heaney has two ideal jobs in mind working concurrently towards web development and graphic design which requires Michael to learn the top three IT skills employers look for, somewhat similar to Brent. With his own skill tree aiming towards a career as an IT field technician, a true asset to ‘Meme Team’ is Lochlann Keenan Keli who brings his goal of hands-on tech support and interpersonal skills helping to create a well-rounded foundation.
