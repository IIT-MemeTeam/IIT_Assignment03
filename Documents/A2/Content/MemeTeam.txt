We are a team of 6 guys who simply just love memes, hence the "Meme-Team"! We enjoy talking in "meme language" in various different I.T chats and that's how we found each other. 
While we understand we occasionally tend to irritate others with the way we talk, this passion for memeing brings us enjoyment and creates team chemistry for us.

Meme-team requirements? Always meme.
