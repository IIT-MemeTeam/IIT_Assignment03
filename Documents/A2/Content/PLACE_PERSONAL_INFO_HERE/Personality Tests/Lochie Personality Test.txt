1. Myers Briggs
With the Myers Briggs test, I got the result of ENFP, which is the Campaigner personality.
an ENFP personality stands for Extraverted, Intuitive, Feeling and Prospecting.
We enjoy the social and emotional connections which we can gain from others.
ENFP people are typically curious, observant, and energetic. This would be useful in a 
team environment. I am very curious as to what everyone has to say about different ideas.

2. Learning Style
I am a visual learner, this means that I need a visual guide to help me learn things. This means
that I may have difficulty understanding, or remembering spoken directions. Visual learners
typically find it easier to read maps and just picture instructions (like idea manuals) compared
to others.

3. Creativity Score
My creativity score is 41.99, which is lower than the typical 63.09 score. My score is
average in all categories, except for Persistence. This means that I cannot easily shift my view 
on situations. I typically have one point of view and stick with it.
