I feel that these results line up pretty well with what I have experienced
throughout my life so far, with being an extremely introverted and shy person
but also enjoying the occasional company of others. I am artistic, curious and
always help others where I can, but find my own self esteem to be extremely low,
 get stressed easily and prefer to work on my own.

I think this will make it difficult for me to integrate well into a team,
especially with my social issues and shows that I have areas to improve on.
Communication and planning is key in working with a team, which will require me
to rely on others for these areas while I bring my own set of skills to
contribute to the team.
