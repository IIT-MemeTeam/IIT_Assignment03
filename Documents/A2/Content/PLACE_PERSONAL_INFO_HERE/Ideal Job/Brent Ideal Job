My ideal job is in application development. This position Iâ€™ve listed involves developing mobile-based applications
that aid in the daily organization of businesses in a digital format. To me, this is appealing because I strive to
be innovative, and I like creating things that are useful and helpful to people. The intended audience for the
application targets workplace industries, which I have an extensive background in, so I understand the demand for 
less paperwork. The skills involved in creating apps would be coding, such as C++, Java, and Python, while also
having good artistic values to have a nice face and layout of the application.
