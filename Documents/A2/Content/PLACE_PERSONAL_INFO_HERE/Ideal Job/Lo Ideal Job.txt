So far I would love to work as a Field Technician. A Field Technician is someone who
can diagnose issues with clients devices and fix them, help clients to install or setup 
equipment, and help maintain them. The job requires alot of social skills, as a
Field Tech, is the face of the company. The person who the client deals with right away.
This isn't my ultimate dream job as I don't know what I want to do, but this is my current
achievable dream!
