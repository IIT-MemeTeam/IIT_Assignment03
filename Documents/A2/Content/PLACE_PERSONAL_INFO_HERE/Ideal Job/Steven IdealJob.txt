Currently my ideal job would be a software developer for a game studio. I find
this appealing as I have a great passion for video games, logic solving and my
previous experience with Unity has been extremely fun to learn the skills for
game development.

This would include developing games using the Unity engine with C# or Unreal
engine using C++, so experience with one of these game engines is needed. It
would require a good understanding of game design, patterns and deployment to
multiple systems such as PC, console and mobile devices.

I currently have some experience with Unity and have been using C# for a number
of years, including developing for PC, consoles as well as Android based
devices. I have some understanding of design and patterns that are commonly
used for software development.
