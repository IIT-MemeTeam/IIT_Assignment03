Gameplay engineers (Expert) work multiple roles and alongside multiple teams in a game studio. They refine designers code, improve game mechanics, focus on user experience and the overall gameplay of a game. This job in the expert level is particularly appealing to me as it offers a variety of work between creativity and logic, allows a broad perspective of a game project coming together which requires attention to detail, and requires an up to date interest in gameplay trends and their mechanics.â€¨
