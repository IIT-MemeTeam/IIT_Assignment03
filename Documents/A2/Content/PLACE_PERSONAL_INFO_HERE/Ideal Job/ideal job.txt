The ideal job for me is that of a Front End Web Developer.
The role will be helping companies large and small to get a footing on the Online market to reach more then the shop front they have and to do this with Web Design that is eye-catching and easy to use. The skills required for the position is that of excellent use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
Experience in Shopify and also in WordPress to design and host websites Online and make it easier for the client to address there site if they would like to via their login details Online.
The skill-set I currently have that I am now learning JavaScript and HTML and CSS. I have some experience in HTML, I have also made some pages lacking the eye-catching pop needed on WordPress.
I am doing some independent learning aside from my bachelors in IT currently undergoing at RMIT in a strive to better my knowledge and to gain access to the job Iâ€™m striving to achieve and fulfill my dream job
