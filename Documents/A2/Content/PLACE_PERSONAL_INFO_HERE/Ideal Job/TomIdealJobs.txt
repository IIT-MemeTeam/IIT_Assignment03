My dream role is as a Metagame Systems Programmer which actively improve the efficiency of code in a given product
with the integrity of performance and function over anything else,
teams with given tasks are to operate on to a deadline much like movie editing, 
The requirements are heavily orientated with
prior experience with visual c++ and unreal engine witch works towards their titles 
as well as the need to be extremely driven in your work, competent in team dynamics and
great at problem solving, relatively I am
inexperienced but do have small amounts of game design experience from editing
save files (Ricks Game Stuff) and various game elements, I've leant to read a lot of code relevant to titles
Gearbox produces such as BioShock and borderlands, My experience in modifying
code to a means of efficiency for program function rather than braking the game rules and to be team a
orientated indivdual to suit a role of this type.
