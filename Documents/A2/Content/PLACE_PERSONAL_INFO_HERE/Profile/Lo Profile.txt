My name is Lochlann Keenan-Kelli, but you can just call me Lo. My RMIT student number is 
S23872026. I live in Queensland with my fiancee. I spend alot of my free time gaming,
and chilling out. I used to have a dream of setting up an American styled 50's diner.
But this dream got crushed when I realised I do not like working in Hospitality.
So I decided to change my dream to something involving my hobbies;
IT. I have been mucking around with computers ever since I was a very young child,
I was always getting new technology, breaking it, troubleshooting what I did, and then fixing it all
up again.
