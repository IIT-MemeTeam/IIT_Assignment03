Hello there I'll start with a little about myself I have a background in warehousing and Iâ€™m moving to IT for a career change, I am half German and half Australian, I only speak English.
My education to date is finishing year 12 in 2005 I studied IT and Multimedia throughout my college life but finishing year 12 I pursued a career in warehousing and driving forklifts.
Hobbies I enjoy are four-wheel driving and off-roading with camping overnight in the bush near a river.
I also play the guitar and did so in a band for roughly 4 years touring the East Coast of Australia.
Other pass times I enjoy are playing video games with my 3 children.
