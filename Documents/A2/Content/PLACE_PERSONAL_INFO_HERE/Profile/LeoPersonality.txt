Leonard McDonald, student number s3879586, s3879586@student.rmit.edu.au, 28 Male Australian. When I was in primary school, I had no idea why my brothers friend could play NES roms on his computer while they wouldn’t work on our macintosh, from this starting point my interest in IT and all its workings would manifest. Classmates in my country side high-school were impressed by the small scripts i could write, and as I moved forward my interest developed my skills in problem solving, video editing, and just enough of everything else to play around with at beginner level. I’d like to work on game mechanics, design and video editing in my spare time, and I believe that the skills I learn from working with our group ‘Meme Team’ will benefit me both in the course and my hobbies
