My name is Steven Holman, a student at RMIT with student number s3514124 and am
working with Meme Team. I am 32 years old male currently living in Victoria,
Australia. Computers has been a passion of mine since I was a child, from
growing up watching my brother build a 486 and playing strategy games on it
such as Civilization and UFO Enemy Unknown. Programming has since become a
passion of mine of which I wish to expand into a future career.
