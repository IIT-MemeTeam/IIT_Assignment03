My name is Brent Kimm, S3873880, S3873880@student.rmit.edu.au; I am a 30-year-old male from Melbourne, Australia.
I completed VCE in 2008 and have since worked in various roles within the Railway and Civil industries.
When I was 5 years old, I received a NES for Christmas with the Super Mario Bros. 1 and 2. From there on, I played
a wide array of games before eventually deciding to build my own computer many years later. This is where my 
interest in the field of Information Technology began...

I am extremely passionate about Football and Basketball, being a major Saints and Celtics fan respectively
outside of gaming and computers. I also love fishing, camping, and escaping the hustle and bustle of the city to
explore our beautiful country.
