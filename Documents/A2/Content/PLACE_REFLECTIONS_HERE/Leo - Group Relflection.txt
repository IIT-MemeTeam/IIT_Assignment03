This team works very well together, and I think it shows, everyone pulled their weight and the group dynamic is a testament to how 
quickly strangers can get to know each other when they have similar interests and a fun attitude which the ‘Meme Team’ definitely has. 
Each team member had a healthy amount of urgency, a great deal of communication (multiple times a day inside and outside of Microsoft 
Teams), and often put in humorous enterprising effort, quite surprisingly, this is exactly the team that fits with my personal profile.

As the team name suggests, a downside to our group of individuals is our ability to ‘meme’ or joke around. Many times, we would joke 
around or discuss group work outside of meetings and RMIT approved platforms, but often during a recorded ‘Teams’ call we would get 
side-tracked and distracted. If something were to be improved it would be our ‘professional image’, though it is my opinion we function 
better with the relaxed nature that’s created otherwise. working in a group allows us all to take on different workloads, simultaneously 
helping each other and returning the favour, I did not know I would be interested in going to team meetings, but I learnt that groups 
can become something to look forward to with the right people.
