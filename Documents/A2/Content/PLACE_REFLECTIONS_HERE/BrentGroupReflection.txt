Overall, I am very pleased with assignment 2. Outside of a few personal commitments that team members have needed to attend, all 
meetings have had full attendance, have been very punctual and we have met all our required dates.

I feel the agenda for each meeting could have been improved upon. As soon as we finished discussion on the required topics, we
were essentially filling in the minimum required time by chatting for the rest of the meeting. A more detailed list of tasks is 
required in the future.

I was surprised by how well our group got along. A team project rarely coheres perfectly together; however, ours seemed to do so. 
Everyone was very understanding about the needs of personal commitments and the flexibility required to work around that. After 
every meeting, team members would sit around and chat about the uni course, the assignment, gaming, and plenty of other things.

What I learned is that it is impossible for each member to contribute an equal amount in a team environment. Whilst our group 
definitely did not have any slackers per se, I felt a couple of team members carried a huge output over the course of the 
assignment. In a perfect world, everyone would contribute the same; however, in almost all workplaces I have been involved in, 
there are definitely people who naturally achieve more than others. I found the important thing is not to stress what others have 
(or have not) done and focus on what I can do to help the team.

Our Github activity has been a really positive asset to our project. Each member has made outstanding contributions toward it, 
in particular our Coders. Although I am not in the coding part of our team, I imagine GitHub made their roles much easier.
