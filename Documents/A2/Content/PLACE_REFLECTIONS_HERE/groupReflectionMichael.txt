In my reflection of our assignment 2 group, I feel we gelled very well with each other. We had a good understanding of when there was 
a time for fun and games and when we had to be serious and focus on the tasks at the end.

Although a positive aspect of our meetings was high attendance and punctuality, we lacked a clear agenda and seemed to get sidetracked 
quite easily. In saying that, this was only our first team assignment together, and it was a massive learning experience for all of us.
A positive outcome through this is that we got to know each other well and become friends, which, in turn, will lead to better results
when it comes to working together again in the future. I have learned that in group settings, there is a requirement to understand 
everyone and where they are coming from and understand that their views on certain situations will likely differ from mine. 
I feel GitHub has helped track our uploads but not what we have done off-site say editing files and research away from the site.
