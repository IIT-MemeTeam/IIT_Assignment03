Group Reflection Lo
I feel as though the team has had an outstanding dynamic throughout the course of assignment 2. We all attended every meeting on time,
and if not, we would let our team members know well in advance. We would stay on topic as close as possible, although we could have
done better in this regard. At times, it did become rather unprofessional with the off-topic chat; however, I think that was more a
reflection of how well we got along working with each other. I felt very comfortable with everyone, and there has been a tremendous
amount of support between all of us. Tasks have been completed on time.

All of us would communicate as to when we could finish our tasks, and if we could not, we would let the other team members know.
All of the meetings were planned around each other's schedules. There were no clashes between anybody. We set-up our team, Meme Team,
within the first week or so, allowing us plenty of time to get to know everyone and figure out how we could help each other.
