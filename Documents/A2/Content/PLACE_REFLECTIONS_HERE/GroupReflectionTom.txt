For me, our group, The Meme Team, was particularly fluent when given specific direction or requirements and would actively communicate 
and collaborate to delegate issues to those who can solve them. 

We had a good understanding of each other's unique skillsets, which we would then willingly workaround, increasing the overall productivity. 
We had amazing flexibility as a team, which was necessary when knowing that each member has different commitments outside of study and also 
being from multiple different timezones. I found that the group dynamic and rapid ability to solve arising conflicts were extremely good, 
and we would resolve any issues within the current meeting or a sufficient frame of time in a polite and often humorous manner while still 
remaining productive.

I found it very enjoyable and was amazed to be able to maintain a playful mood among my group members and still pertain to a constructive 
atmosphere, stay focused on the task at hand but still having fun with the work given.
Generally, I find it a struggle to work with others, in particular in getting my point of information across efficiently and found that in
 this case, I was given acquit time and respect to get through our meetings appropriately.
 
In retrospect, I am quite satisfied with our team's overall efforts, especially through the use of GitHub, which made life easy from a 
collaborative aspect. I look forward to our group's next assignment and any possible future work with my companions at hand.
