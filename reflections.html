												The Meme Team as of working toward Assignment 3 became
												heavily focused on formal structure and setting earlier
												deadlines on tasks with a dedicated section allowing
												delegation and tracking of work done by members and
												found great constructive feedback towards my own
												mannerisms whilst maintaining our playful domineer and
												focusing on the important work and have been able to
												reflect upon how I interact with groups and work towards
												a more constructive and focused individual.
											</p>

											<p>
												I found it amazing that we could collectively agree upon
												what our weaknesses were in the previous assessment and
												gravitate directly to practical solutions such as
												allowing time for editors prior too submission and
												focusing on presentation and references through the
												processes of construction in assignment 3 rather than in
												hindsight and pre-emptively create more functional
												representation as a reflection of our work as its
												created, through this assignment I was able to more
												confidently rely on my group as of the established trust
												in the quality of produced work and joyfully communicate
												issues and come too solid solutions which I feel as
												individual was a past struggle and a great personal
												learning curve towards my ideal job (Meta Game System
												Programmer) in which team dynamics as well adaptive
												problem solving are essential which is one aspect I need
												to greatly focus towards and am thankful for my group
												work for highlighting.
