									<h3 class="major">Group Reflection</h3>
									<p>
										As a team, we felt that the Meme-Team was in a much stronger
										position for Assignment 3 than we were for Assignment 2, as
										we already knew each other’s strengths and weaknesses from
										this period. By utilizing Microsoft Teams and creating a
										task checklist at the beginning of assignment 3, we were
										better equipped to delegate the tasks that needed to be
										completed, sharing the workload evenly over the whole team.
										Team organisation was an area we struggled with previously
										throughout assignment 2. Over the course of these
										assignments, we have formed a strong bond, which has created
										morale and lead to a boost in team chemistry. This created
										enjoyment for us and wanting to complete work, rather than
										feeling like a chore as some assignments are.
									</p>
									<p>
										Although we were great at delegating work and sticking to
										our checklist of tasks, we still had some tasks left to the
										last minute. This could be improved upon with better
										organization, such as putting deadlines on individual tasks,
										which would lead to more fluidity, and less of a last-minute
										rush to try and complete them. Our log minutes throughout
										meetings in Assignment 3 were not as great as in Assignment
										2, thus making it difficult to find information and keynotes
										from specific meetings. Keeping a high quality and organized
										log of minutes from meetings and any timestamps on crucial
										moments in these meetings would have saved time by not
										having to backtrack through recordings to remember any
										missed information.
									</p>
									<p>
										As a group, we were surprised that we had been working
										together over the whole time, and not once was there a fight
										or verbal altercation. There were disagreements at certain
										times, as all teams have, but we always managed to smooth
										things over and come up with an ultimatum that would suit
										everyone, which we think is the key to having success in a
										group setting. It was also surprising to us that there was
										still to learn in this assignment from a team management
										perspective.
									</p>
									<p>
										We have been lucky that our group dynamic in a team setting
										has been remarkably cohesive, built upon by sharing common
										interests and getting along well. We have learned that team
										members have lives outside of study and working around these
										personal commitments can be challenging but crucial to
										building strong chemistry and achieving the goals set from
										the beginning. As a team, we are proud of what we have been
										able to accomplish with our Mimi-Box. We have all worked
										hard to create a product that we are passionate about, while
										still maintaining a level of fun that is required for
										potential future endeavours.

												Over the course of Assignment 3, the Meme-Team did well
												at creating a system of tasks needing to be completed
												for submission and delegated them evenly to spread the
												workload evenly amongst all 6 team members. This is a
												big contrast from Assignment 2, where the bulk of the
												work, mostly coding based, revolved around a few people.
												In contrast, others did not have as much input as they
												would have desired. Although the workload was shared
												evenly overall, Steven was still responsible for most of
												the project’s programming side, much the same as
												assignment 2. As we advance, the rest of the Meme-Team
												members, including myself, could brush up on our coding
												skills and take some pressure off Steven, releasing him
												to do various other tasks.
											</p>
											<p>
												For me personally, I found it surprising just how much
												knowledge my team members had on computer hardware in
												general. They already knew exactly what hardware
												components were required for the Mimi-Box to function,
												just because they all have great knowledge in computer
												building before beginning this course with RMIT. This
												was quite the opposite for me personally, as I had to
												research thoroughly to understand what they were talking
												about. It was good to soak in all this knowledge they
												already had and learn from the things they discussed.
											</p>
											<p>
												Over the course of Assignment 3, I learned that there
												will always be a team member who is weak in a certain
												area in a team environment, whether this is programming,
												research, or writing. Personally, I feel I am getting
												better at writing, to the point where I like to help
												others who are not as strong in this area and proofread
												and edit their work when required. Likewise, coding is
												my weakness, and I am happy to learn and take advice and
												constructive criticism from team members such as Steven
												and Thomas as much as I can.

												Meme-team performed well together for these assignments,
												every team member fell into their tasks within their
												personally available time, producing results quickly
												allowing for reflection and updating or working on a
												task slowly until completion. Meme-team prepared well
												with researching the assignment rubric and breaking down
												every part of the assignment document which allowed even
												distribution of the workload. There were no issues with
												job roles as each member used the task system in
												Microsoft teams to allocate themselves work to their
												strengths, all of us offering to help others at
												different points in the assignment.
											</p>
											<p>
												Some tasks were small and much easier to complete, but
												this didn’t stop some of us from leaving them to the
												last minute. Unfortunately, a couple of these
												unprioritized tasks had an adverse effect on the other
												tasks as they would contain information that would have
												been useful in specific moments. Tasks that provide
												information, meetings minutes for searching meeting
												logs, video editing material, all of these could benefit
												from a better understanding of the timeless they incur
												when left last minute.
											</p>
											<p>
												I was surprised by the group members reflections on
												their spark plus reviews to each other, each member
												mentioning about their peers' feedback towards their
												behaviour in passing, then making active choices to
												consider it. I have learnt that team chemistry is
												important to how the team functions, with everyone
												willing to work hard when they feel respected and are as
												friends.

												Meme-Team had a significant understanding of what was
												needed to get done for Assignment 3 and 5. Once again,
												we all worked very well together. Within the first week,
												there wasn’t a lot done by me as I felt like I didn’t
												have a role. But every other team member pulled their
												weight. By the second week, we had created tasks for
												everyone to complete by a specific date which made it a
												lot easier. This allowed us to keep on track. However, a
												few due dates for tasks were delayed as some of our
												group had events happening in their personal lives which
												were unavoidable.
											</p>
											<p>
												I feel as though we did a fantastic job; however, I
												would have liked to contribute more to the tasks which
												were created in Teams. Brent did a tremendous job with
												completing his tasks considering he was M.I.A for one
												week for his wedding, Thomas and Michael did a great job
												researching everything. Steven once again has produced a
												quality looking website, and Leonard had made quality
												written content.

												The Meme Team as a group moving from assignment two (2)
												worked out each other's strengths and weaknesses that we
												had not be able to work out in the short time before
												assignment two (2) and played the team members to the
												strengths. We had more meetings as a team than we did
												prior to assignment three (3) in turn this kept each
												member on track to meet deadlines and the ability to
												bounce ideas around fast then in a text-based chat
												system like Microsoft Teams&trade;. or Discord&trade;.
											</p>
											<p>
												I personally found the way the team felt more of a
												cohesive unit then when we were working on assignment
												two (2). We achieved more as a unit then we did prior,
												knowing each other’s strengths. Having the multiple
												meetings each week kept us all on track to make
												deadlines possible and in turn getting more work done,
												if one member was struggling or had outside influenced
												issues another member was willing and ready to pick up
												that task to achieve the desired deadline. Having the
												desired deadlines has allowed a buffer and grace time
												for the members having strengths in spelling and editing
												side of the work more time to make the information flow
												much more consistently and making the pages flow more
												professionally. As a team we had some issues with some
												design flaws showing up, in the meetings we overcome
												these with a quick chat in a live meeting on Microsoft
												Teams&trade; to come to a solution. The team meetings have
												helped me not be so quiet and sit in the corner and come
												out of my shell and talk to people more, I believe this
												has helped me with my goal of Front-End Web Developer. I
												have had some flaws point out and I am working on them
												and for this team and this course, I am thankful.

												Overall, the Meme Team performed well, just like last
												assignment. We have created a friendship amongst the
												team and still have conversations that go on past our
												regular meeting schedule. People were happy to put their
												hand up to take on tasks that were laid out and asked
												the team relevant questions or for help when required.
											</p>
											<p>
												Most meetings were productive, with high attendance from
												everyone. Last time meetings could get a little
												side-tracked, but they were more focused this time
												around. We did use a task planner to organise what
												needed to be done and give deadlines for each task, but
												some were started late, including my own, which could be
												improved in the future.
											</p>
											<p>
												I was still surprised at the team growth that occurred
												during this time, and thoroughly enjoyed getting to know
												each and every member of the team. And while I learnt
												last time how hard it is to organise a team, I was also
												surprised and how much I still had to learn in regard to
												team management. It's a difficult task to get everything
												working right, but it pays off when it does.

												The Meme Team as of working toward Assignment 3 became
												heavily focused on formal structure and setting earlier
												deadlines on tasks with a dedicated section allowing
												delegation and tracking of work done by members and
												found great constructive feedback towards my own
												mannerisms whilst maintaining our playful domineer and
												focusing on the important work and have been able to
												reflect upon how I interact with groups and work towards
												a more constructive and focused individual.
											</p>
											<p>
												I found it amazing that we could collectively agree upon
												what our weaknesses were in the previous assessment and
												gravitate directly to practical solutions such as
												allowing time for editors prior too submission and
												focusing on presentation and references through the
												processes of construction in assignment 3 rather than in
												hindsight and pre-emptively create more functional
												representation as a reflection of our work as its
												created, through this assignment I was able to more
												confidently rely on my group as of the established trust
												in the quality of produced work and joyfully communicate
												issues and come too solid solutions which I feel as
												individual was a past struggle and a great personal
												learning curve towards my ideal job (Meta Game System
												Programmer) in which team dynamics as well adaptive
												problem solving are essential which is one aspect I need
												to greatly focus towards and am thankful for my group
												work for highlighting.
