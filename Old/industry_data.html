											<p>My ideal job is in Application Development with React Native, and I would be
												classified as a .NET Developer. According to the Burning Glass data, the demand
												for this role is high as it is ranked at #3, this has reinforced my desire to
												explore this role to a greater extent. I feel as though I already possess the
												general skills required for this role. I am very interested in my brief studies
												with IT-related skills and I think a career in this field would be a good fit
												for me.</p>

											<img class="modalImg image fit right" style="margin:auto" src="images/profiles/leonard/ideal-job.png" onclick="openModal(this);" alt="Leonard's ideal job: Expert Gameplay Engineer">
											<p>My ideal job requires IT skills that
												I hadnâ€™t considered before researching the burning glass technologies data and
												talking among my team members, some of these skills require only the basic use
												and understanding, i.e. SQL. I had originally researched a career which would
												maintain my interest and allow consistent learning and creativity, this ideal
												job has not changed but with the burning glass data I have gained an idea of the
												technologies businesses find useful and I will use this experience to continue
												to look towards IT predictions.

											<p>So far, my ideal job has not
												changed. This is because I am currently focusing on a job which I feel is
												achievable within my skill sets. As I start to progress through the course my
												ideal job will most likely change but right now, I would like to aim for what I
												feel most comfortable with and along the way find whether or not I change my
												goal. I would like to take my IT career in different stages. A quick search of
												Field Technician Jobs on <a href=https://www.seek.com.au/field-technician-jobs>Seek.com</a>
												shows 3,582 jobs availabilities (17th Oct 2020)

										<p>There are two ideal jobs that take my
											interest. First is in web development which ranks at #15 in the burning glass
											technologies data, and the second is graphic design ranking at #2. Both of these
											jobs have similar skill requirements yet donâ€™t directly link or overlap. As it
											stands after more research, I will need to expand my current skillset to make
											these ideal jobs more achievable, but my ideal jobs have not changed.

										<p>I do not believe that my ideal job has
											changed at all. Being a .NET developer has been a goal of mine for a long time
											and is a field that I already have experience with. I previously understood the
											skills required to perform this job and am trying to gain as much knowledge
											about it to start my career in this field.

										<p>My Ideal Job is the role of (Metagames
											system programmer) test analysis, or in other words, quality assurance in the
											video game industry. Having considered the presented Burning Glass Technologyâ€™s
											data my consideration of an ideal job has not been reconsidered. I reason that I
											will require branching into some higher demand skills primarily communication &
											further exploration of JavaScript.

								<p>The â€˜Meme Teamâ€™s Brent Kimmâ€™s ideal job is in application development using
									the open-source mobile application framework â€˜React Nativeâ€™ as a .NET developer.
									This Ideal Job overlaps with team member Steve Holman who has experience in .NET
									programming, While Brent will require JavaScript and JAVA, Steve has
									purposefully focused on Microsoft C# and Git. </p>

									<p>These â€˜Meme Teamâ€™ team members
									have similar ideal jobs titles with varying skill requirements, in a similar
									situation to Thomas Lewis and Leonard McDonald who are both aiming for test
									analyst. With Thomas focusing on metagames system programmer and Leonard with
									the goal of gameplay engineer, the differences between these job roles are
									minute but not to be ignored as Thomasâ€™ role is closer to unambiguity and
									Leonard leans towards a project management skillset. While these members focus
									on software and game systems, Michael Heaney has two ideal jobs in mind working
									concurrently towards web development and graphic design which requires Michael
									to learn the top three IT skills employers look for, somewhat similar to Brent.</p>

									<p>With his own skill tree aiming towards a career as an IT field technician, a
									true asset to â€˜Meme Teamâ€™ is Lochlann Keenan Keli who brings his goal of
									hands-on tech support and interpersonal skills helping to create a well-rounded
									foundation. </p>
