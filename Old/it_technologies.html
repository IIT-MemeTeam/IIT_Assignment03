												Autonomous vehicles are essentially driverless cars; in
												summation, these vehicles can completely and safely
												navigate their way around the environment with little to
												no human input.
											</p>
											<p>
												The concept of self-driving cars is simple; however, the
												complex technologies, potential safety issues, and
												ethical concerns are what is stopping it from becoming a
												mainstream technology in the present state. For
												Australia's current technological climate, our latest
												road vehicles have automated features, such as
												self-parking, lane-keep assistance, and distance assist;
												however, this only aids with driving. A licensed human
												still needs to have full control over the car. It is
												estimated that over the next 20 years
												<a href="#autonomous_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>. vehicles in
												Australia will not need human drivers at all while
												vehicles increasingly become fully automated.
											</p>
											<p>
												Regulations play a massive part in the complete
												autonomation of vehicles. There are 5 vehicle automation
												levels following the United Nations Economic Commission
												for Europe (UNECE) World Forum for Harmonization of
												Vehicle Regulations
												<a href="#autonomous_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>. Level 1 is the
												current driver-assist features, as mentioned earlier.
												Level 2 is Tesla's Autopilot system, where drivers are
												expected to keep attention on traffic. Level 3, the
												driver can do other various things such as use phones
												and watch movies. Level 4 is the stage where drivers no
												longer have to be ready to intervene if necessary, and
												Level 5 is complete automation.
											</p>
											<img class="modalImg image fit right" onclick="openModal(this);" src="images/it-technologies/autonomous-vehicle.jpg" alt="Autonomous Vehicles sensors"></img>
											<p>
												Sensor technology is an integral system in autonomous
												vehicle development. These essentially allow the vehicle
												to see the environment around them, such as surrounding
												vehicles, pedestrians, weather, and other general
												traffic hazards. One such sensor technology system that
												has already been developed is called 'Advanced Driver
												Assistance Systems' <a href="#autonomous_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>, which are commonly implemented
												in most modern car's safety systems. For the modern car,
												these are not operable directly by the driver but assist
												in crash prevention and parking. By and large, visual
												sensors are the predominant technology implemented by
												ADAS, in addition to lidar (light detection and ranging)
												and radar (radio detection and ranging). The hardware
												and software of ADAS used in modern cars are now being
												targeted towards autonomous vehicles and the future of
												driverless cars, becoming one of the many parts that
												make up an autonomous vehicle. The growth in this field
												of technology will help fast track the implementation of
												automated services.
											</p>
											<p>
												Another area of technological advancements required for
												autonomous vehicles is machine learning. Autonomous
												vehicles will use both AI and Machine learning to
												process data collected from its sensors and then decide
												what it will do with the information from
												there<a href="#autonomous_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>.Machine Learning will calculate algorithms to
												identify certain objects and hazards that the sensors
												detect to determine what course of action the vehicle
												needs to take moving forward. Machine learning by its
												very design improves reactions and the decision making
												of autonomous vehicles with every additional set of
												data; this allows the 'car' to make decisions and
												perform actions that are far safer and quicker than the
												everyday human can react. Furthermore, machine learning
												technology<a href="#autonomous_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> will identify risks, human error, and
												potential hazards on the road from subtle signs most
												humans will not notice. This allows the machine learning
												system to 'learn,' collect data and share this data with
												all other autonomous cars in the system. As technology
												progresses, machine learning will make autonomous
												vehicles more efficient than a human driver can.
											</p>
											<p>
												This development's obvious impact allows road users to
												spend more time doing things they would rather be doing
												within their vehicle's confines, such as playing with
												their phones, watching movies, studying, or even
												catching up on sleep. If automation technology is
												perfected, it also eliminates human error in car
												accidents, making it a very effective safety measure.
												According to the Pennsylvania Department of
												Transportation, driver actions account for over 90% of
												motor vehicle accidents in the United States of America.
												Eliminating human error will result in a significant
												decline in crashes and fatalities. Not only does this
												have a significant impact on safety concerns, but many
												positive environmental factors come into play with
												self-driving vehicles. It is predicted that eventually,
												automated driving efficiency will reduce road traffic,
												leading to reduced fuel consumption and, in turn, reduce
												Carbon dioxide emissions. According to placesjounal.org,
												"analysts predict that by 2050 self-driving cars will
												save 59,000 lives and 250 million commuting hours
												annually and support a new "passenger economy" worth USD
												7 trillion."<a href="#autonomous_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a>
											</p>
											<p>
												While this does have a significant positive impression
												on daily commuters, it severely impacts our transport
												industries, such as Taxis, Uber, Bus companies, and
												government-funded rail networks, while also affecting
												the logistical networks like Truck drivers and Couriers.
												Without human drivers, businesses can potentially save
												hundreds of thousands in staff salaries by automating
												vehicle services. In the mining and agriculture
												industries, we have already seen how automated machines
												can eliminate the need for human operation and have made
												operating roles redundant. Mining Company Roy Hill,
												which is majority-owned by mining magnate Gina
												Rinehart's company Hancock Prospecting has agreed to
												convert 77 of their haul trucks from manned to
												completely autonomous by 2021<a href="#autonomous_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a>, effectively putting 77
												truck drivers out of a job. This is following the lead
												of other mining giants such as Rio Tinto and BHP. This
												will leave a huge footprint on the mining industry, no
												longer needing to hire people in this position ever
												again whilst beneficially lining the investors' pockets.
												According to the Australia Taxi Industry Association<a href="#autonomous_8"><sup>[7]</sup></a>,
												as of December 2014, there were 21,344 total Taxis owned
												and operated in Australia. Not if, but when self-driving
												vehicles come into full automation, one would surmise
												this will conclusively lead to an end to the need for
												human-operated Taxi's, thus putting 21,344 Australians
												in the search for other jobs.
											</p>
											<p>
												For me, personally, this has a significant positive
												effect on my life. As a Welder for V/Line, I am required
												to drive a truck for the daily purposes within my job
												description - however, it is not the sole reason I am
												employed as the duties of working as a welder fulfill my
												primary role. If truck automation became a mainstay, it
												would allow so much extra time to cover other daily
												tasks such as paperwork and organizing orders,
												optimizing the time it takes traveling to and from job
												sites while still performing my primary welding task. On
												the contrary, my father is a locomotive driver with
												V/Line. Although it is not car automation, Australia's
												train driving industry's growing concern is complete
												train automation, which would render his employment
												redundant. Australian federal parliamentary research
												into automated trains showed increases in efficiency,
												reliability, and safety while significantly saving
												labour costs. There are currently 42 cities worldwide<a href="#autonomous_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a>
												that enjoy the reliable service of automated public
												railway transport, with more than an outstanding 50
												percent of them belonging to Asia. While this is
												extremely positive for traffic reduction, pollution, and
												cost-effectiveness, the repercussions are that it puts
												hundreds of thousands out of employment worldwide,
												including locomotive drivers, conductors, engineers, and
												potentially other railway staff well. Although this is
												not exactly car autonomation, there are many resembling
												characteristics between self-driving trains,
												self-driving cars, self-driving trucks, and so on, these
												making up the category of autonomous vehicles.

											<p>
												A Blockchain<a href="#blockchain_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> is the peer-to-peer technology that
												permits users with a common interest to co-create
												ledgers of transactions without the need to trust the
												other parties in the peer-to-peer network or the need to
												rely on a central authority <a href="#blockchain_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>, these ledgers are
												transparent, unchangeable, and stored as verified copy’s
												between multiple nodes.
											</p>
											<p>
												A transaction is finalised into a block not unlike a
												page in a paper ledger <a href="#blockchain_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>, all blocks are chained from
												the original block to the most recent block creating the
												ledger timeline. A single party or parties are unable to
												make an unauthorised change to the ledger due to there
												being no one central clearing authority who can allow or
												deny the change, it’s essentially all the users of the
												peer-to-peer network who authorise adding a block by
												checking all the previous blocks in the chain, thus
												changing a block that is already part of the chain is
												not possible.
											</p>
											<img class="image fit left" src="images/it-technologies/blockchain.jpg" alt="Blockchain"></img>
											<p>
												Although the name cryptocurrency<a
												href="#blockchain_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a> has the word
												“currency”, it is better to refer to cryptocurrency as a
												medium of exchange, this is due to the debate that a
												currency shouldn’t have intrinsic value, though being a
												medium of exchange is essentially the same thing. These
												mediums of exchange use the blockchain technology to
												validate and legitimise transactions, a person can own
												cryptocurrency and use it to purchase goods and services
												privately and securely.
											</p>
											<br>
											<p>
												Because cryptocurrency is not regulated, it first found
												its use by criminals on the internet’s black market,
												though now many users have come to cryptocurrency for
												its practicality, speed, and security.
											</p>
											<p>
												Spotify <a href="#blockchain_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> is a good example of how blockchain
												technology is used today, Spotify is using a
												decentralised database to allow artist to be consistent
												with license agreements and tracks. They are attempting
												to solve the issues of artist and labels in the industry
												which are not being fairly acknowledged with blockchains
												transparency and unchangeable ledgers.
											</p>
											<p>
												A good example of what could be done soon (and is in
												development) is with banking<a href="#blockchain_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a>, currently in order to
												transfer currency from an Australian bank to another
												country it requires the money to go through multiple
												banks with multiple layers of intermediation, taking an
												undetermined amount of time without a clear ledger of
												where the money travelled. Blockchain technology can
												securely move digital assets without the need of these
												banks or third parties, this also allows financial
												services access for people who didn’t have this access
												before and removes many of the transaction and
												processing fees involved in moving Fiat currency.
											</p>
											<p>
												Blockchain<a href="#blockchain_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> is made up of the past and current
												transaction ledgers as ‘blocks’, so, to add a new block,
												first a miner would attempt to add the transaction(s) as
												the newest block to the chain. For a miner to be able to
												achieve this, they must run a full node with the entire
												transaction data of the blockchain, this data will be
												compared to data from the other nodes in the
												peer-to-peer network to verify its legitimacy.
												Furthermore, the miner must complete an energy intensive
												mathematical equation using the RAM, CPU, and graphics
												card of their device while competing with other miners
												for the right to add the latest transaction to the
												blockchain. As they are using their energy and hardware
												(technology with computational power, i.e. computers,
												phones, servers), Miners are ofttimes incentivised with
												rewards of cryptocurrency in exchange for performing the
												tasks which keeps the blockchain maintained.
											</p>
											<p>
												As these transactions are broadcasted to the
												peer-to-peer network of nodes, the node’s job is to
												store, spread, and keep the transaction history of the
												blockchain data as this forms the infrastructure of the
												blockchain and is considered the blockchain itself.
												These nodes use known algorithms to check and verify the
												transactions and user’s status. Once validated by the
												nodes, the transaction combines with the previous blocks
												in the chain, creating a new block that consist of the
												previous and current transactions and their data. The
												new block is added to the chain where it can no longer
												be altered or moved. A node simply acts as a gatekeeper
												with a directory of the blockchain transaction history,
												as well as updating other nodes that are coming online
												or are outdated.
											</p>
											<p>
												This Technology can be used to create secure
												communication in hostile environments, there is no need
												to rely on trust<a href="#blockchain_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> when using a decentralised system
												like blockchain as it enables every user to have equal
												privileges. With blockchain technology there is no good
												or bad, right or wrong, there is only valid or invalid.
												This is changing some jobs already, for instance; Job’s
												involved with supply chain’s no longer need an
												intermediary to process and account all the transactions
												between a business deal<a href="#blockchain_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>, as blockchain is a reliable
												foolproof record that the ecosystems of business
												partners can easily adopt. Thus, for some jobs, the
												impact of this technology has removed the time, effort,
												and management involved that would require checking
												ledgers and accounts, as well as making some jobs
												redundant.
											</p>
											<p>
												It is hard to say who is likely to be most affected by
												blockchain technology and cryptocurrency, as this
												technology is truly not bound by geography it is very
												possible that the citizens of a country such as
												Venezuela<a href="#blockchain_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> (Venezuelan’s are currently in an economic
												crisis) would look to cryptocurrency to bypass their
												hyperinflated fiat currency as this can act as an
												alternative payment for goods and services.
											</p>

											<p>
												Blockchain technology allows businesses to process data
												faster and more efficiently, sometimes by cutting out
												the middleman entirely and other times by changing old
												jobs or even adding new jobs. An example of blockchain
												creating new jobs could be the role of creating the
												standardised template for a business to enter their
												data, data entry, running a node or mining, and even
												increasing jobs in hardware maintenance.
											</p>
											<p>
												There are also talks about availability of people’s
												information, one Forbes article wrote about the
												permanent storage of customer health data and their
												identity which will allow health care systems to
												accurately find your medical history. This can be a
												major benefit for medical service providers and their
												customers as it saves time, unfortunately this also
												creates the debate about privacy, who really controls
												your health records stored on multitudes of computers,
												can you delete it?
											</p>
											<p>
												To the average Australian, blockchain and cryptocurrency
												will not be a technology they actively know they are
												using until cryptocurrency and its uses are adopted by
												businesses and systems that already have their place in
												society i.e. banks and supermarkets, or until blockchain
												is used to store citizens data. It may take a while for
												this technology to be used by a health care system or as
												a form of in store payment. Personally, I would not want
												my medical history stored in a capacity that doesn’t
												allow it to be erased. For some people this could create
												a roadblock for potential jobs or government forms, If
												the person is not breaking a law, then they have the
												right and choice to prevent their private information
												from the prying eyes of employers and authorities,
												wishing to keep some specific information ignorant.
												Private and confidential information will always
												interest individuals and businesses with malicious
												intent or greed. If it is possible that personal data
												can be stored and viewed by others, then who should be
												allowed to make entries and who should be allowed to
												view the data? As an example of a potential road this
												technology might move towards, a previous employer would
												have all the power over x-employee if they were allowed
												to leave a employment profile review.
											</p>
											<p>
												As new technology, Blockchain and Cryptocurrency are not
												regulated by the government, but laws are always able to
												be created and laws are able to be changed. In the
												interest of keeping my family’s private information safe
												This brings up concern for my family and myself about
												our privacy. The ability to take advantage of blockchain
												technology doesn’t provide much difference in my daily
												life as it hasn’t been adopted by most of the systems
												that I already use, and if it were adopted, then one way
												I would use this technology would be to transfer money
												between my families and my own foreign and Australian
												bank accounts while I’m traveling abroad.
											</p>
											<p>
												As an example of the use for us students looking for a
												career in the IT industry, the ability to create a side
												project outside of work hours and storing the ongoing
												documentation in an unchangeable ledger very well may
												affect some of us. To have unchangeable dated and timed
												documentation may be very useful to some students who
												wish to protect their intellectual property against a
												company that claims they used company time or resources
												to work on the project.
											</p>
											<p>
												As a whole, I like the idea of cryptocurrency and how it
												can improve our lives, and the technology of blockchain
												for removing the trust involved in business, yet I am
												weary about the possibilities of a system that has the
												ability to leak private and confidential information.

										<button class="accordion actions fit">Cloud Services</button>
										<div class="panel">
											<br>
											<p>
												Cloud Services and Cloud Computing is the delivery of
												various internet service. An On-demand technology where
												users can utilize IT resources over the internet and
												work on these services as a pay per use mechanic, rather
												than a subscription-based service, which charges users
												periodically. Cloud computing also enables the user to
												store data and resources in a server on other premises.
												It allows the user to access information from any point
												of access around the globe; all they need is an internet
												connection and the correct user credentials. Services
												through cloud technology, are growing by the day, there
												are usually three types of models used in cloud
												services.
											</p>
											<p>
												The first form is Software as a Service (SaaS). SaaS
												uses the web to convey applications, which are overseen
												by an outside seller to its clients. The majority of
												SaaS applications run directly through your internet
												browser, which implies they do not need any downloads or
												establishments on the customer side. Because of its web
												conveyance model, SaaS wipes out the need to have IT
												staff download and install applications on every
												individual PC. With SaaS, merchants deal with all
												expected specialized issues, for example, data,
												middleware, servers, and storage, resulting in
												streamlined maintenance and support for the business.
												SaaS gives various preferences to workers and
												organizations by extraordinarily diminishing the time
												and cash spent on repetitive assignments, for example,
												installing, overseeing, and updating software. This
												allows much time for specialized staff to spend on more
												concerning issues and issues inside the organization.
											</p>
											<p>
												The second form of cloud service is Platform as a
												Service (PaaS). PaaS delivers specific software while
												being utilized for applications. PaaS conveys a
												structure for designers that they can expand upon and
												use to make modified applications. The enterprise or an
												outsider supplier can oversee all servers, storage, and
												networking while the designers can keep up the board of
												the applications. The delivery model of PaaS is like
												SaaS, aside from as opposed to conveying the product
												over the web, PaaS gives a stage to programming
												creation. This stage is transmitted by utilizing the
												web, allowing engineers to focus on building the product
												without agonizing over working frameworks, programming
												updates, storage, or infrastructure. This cloud service
												can enormously lessen expenses, and improve a few
												difficulties that surface in the event that you are
												quickly creating or sending an application.
											</p>
											<p>
												The third form of cloud service is Infrastructure as a
												Service (IaaS). IaaS is made of exceptionally adaptable
												and mechanized figure assets. IaaS is entirely
												self-administration for getting to and monitoring the
												computer, systems administration, networking, storage,
												and other services. IaaS permits organizations to buy
												assets on-request and varying as opposed to purchasing
												equipment outright. IaaS delivers cloud computing
												infrastructure, including servers, operating systems,
												networks, and storage, through virtualization
												technology. These cloud servers are generally given to
												the organization through a dashboard or an API, giving
												IaaS customers unlimited oversight over the whole
												foundation. IaaS provides similar technologies and
												storage as a traditional data centre without having to
												keep up or deal with every last bit of it. IaaS
												customers can, in any case, get to their servers and
												storage directly, yet it is wholly redistributed through
												a "virtual data centre" in the cloud.
											</p>
											<p>
												Rather than SaaS or PaaS, IaaS customers are liable for
												overseeing angles, for example; applications, runtime,
												OSes, middleware, and data. Nonetheless, suppliers of
												the IaaS deal with the servers, hard drives, systems
												administration, virtualization, and storage.
											</p>
											<p>
												Over the next few years, there is talk about trying to
												get a Graphics as a Service (GaaS) in relation to the
												demand for high-end Graphics Processing Units (GPU). As
												high-end computers are becoming more in demand for
												gamers and content creators alike to try and get the
												most out of the GPU and CPU, this service that will be a
												fraction of the cost and help all users achieve the
												demands of a high-end system without the overheads
											</p>
											<p>
												Technological developments that make cloud computing
												possible are Broadband networks, and internet
												architecture, as the cloud network needs to be connected
												to the internet to access from anywhere around the
												globe. Datacenter technology in relation to, have a
												large number of servers at one location (e.g. Google
												data centers) all connected to the internet to have
												users connect
											</p>
											<p>
												Also, a need for Virtualization technology is on the
												rise. Virtualization is a process of converting a
												physical IT resource into a virtual IT. Web technology
												and cloud computing rely on the internet. Web technology
												is used as both the implementation medium and the
												management interface for cloud services.
											</p>
											<p>
												Multitenant technology enables multiple users (tenants)
												to access the same application simultaneously.
												Multitenant applications ensure that tenants do not have
												access to data and configuration information that is not
												their own.
											</p>
											<img class="modalImg image fit right" onclick="openModal(this);" src="images/it-technologies/cloud-computing.jpg" alt="Many devices utilise the cloud in the modern age"></img>
											<p>
												The likely impact of the globe changing to a cloud
												service system is that companies can reach around the
												world to do business. IT Help desk can remote access a
												computer and help fix the issues without having to have
												someone go on-site and help their clients. What is
												likely to change concerning cloud services is getting
												faster access to networks to get larger files
												transferred to other virtual computers and your physical
												computer on site. I believe the most affected in the IT
												industry from the movement to Cloud Services would be
												the onsite technicians. With cloud services being
												offsite, there is no need for local technicians for
												machine upgrades or application upgrades. A positive for
												cloud services for the majority of companies is that the
												overhead cost of running day to day is reduced
												drastically and increasing the profits annually. Having
												cloud storage for a company will also reduce the size of
												the building the company will need in turn increasing
												the amount of companies in a concentrated area.
											</p>
											<p>
												Having the data servers off-site and run by other
												companies lowers the cost of maintenance and the need to
												upgrade the computers on site
											</p>
											<p>
												Cloud Computing is used every day by almost everybody
												whether it is online schooling, especially during the
												current global pandemic, to playing and sharing video
												games with friends and family over servers with game
												sharing on the consoles. When I am out and about and
												think about something I need to type into a document, I
												can write it on my phone and then my phone will sync to
												the cloud services I have, when I turn my computer on it
												loads up and syncs to the cloud services, bringing my
												saved document from the cloud to my pc. An excellent
												example of one of these services is OneDrive. I also
												help my mother run a website for the aged care lifestyle
												coordinators around the world, and we both have input on
												the site from WordPress to Dropbox. Without these two
												cloud services, I would not be able to help my mother as
												she is an hour away from my location. My partner uses
												cloud services to stay in touch with the work happening
												in her office as she is working remotely. If we did not
												have these services at hand or readily available
												everything I have mentioned above from schooling online,
												the games we play, to the documents we share between
												friends family and work, without the advances we have
												had in cloud computing and cloud technologies none of
												this would be available

											<h4>What is Cybersecurity? What makes it so important?</h4>
											<p>
												Cybersecurity is a range of technologies, processes, and
												practices which protect data, devices, networks, and
												applications from anything sinister, ranging from
												unauthorised access to purposefully being damaged from a
												cyberattack. According to DNSstuff<a href="#cybersecurity_20"><sup>[20]</sup></a>, the most common
												types of cyberattacks include: SQL Injections, which
												utilises malicious SQL code to access confidential
												information such as sensitive company or customer
												data<a href="#cybersecurity_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>; Phishing Attacks, which is when the attacker
												poses as a trusted individual or company and tricks the
												victim through email, or text, into opening a malicious
												link, which will most likely lead to a malware being
												installed on the victims system<a href="#cybersecurity_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>; and Malware, that
												refers to malicious software that can damage or freeze
												devices, steal sensitive data, and cause general
												chaos.<a href="#cybersecurity_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>
											</p>
											<img class="image fit left" src="images/it-technologies/cybersecurity.jpg" alt="Cybersecurity"></img>
											<p>
												It doesn’t matter who you are or how safe you are, no
												one is invulnerable from a cyberattack. In todays day
												and age, cybersecurity is one of, if not the most,
												necessary types of defence. In our modern society,
												access to technology is essential. Almost everybody uses
												some kind of computer and phone. On most of these
												devices, people keep all their personal information,
												like stored passwords, bank accounts, social media
												accounts, and private photos. Anyone can learn how to
												access and steal this information, with enough time and
												patience. Scamming someone and stealing their data, is
												as easy as sending an email, or borrowing their phone to
												“make a call”.
											</p>
											<p>
												There are various ways to be protected, the main, of
												course, is downloading an antivirus/antimalware program,
												which can help to protect devices from malicious
												programs and individuals. This may seem like enough
												protection for some people. However, others use VPNs
												(Virtual Private Network) to route their internet
												connection through a providers private server, creating
												a “tunnel” which encrypts your data.
											</p>
											<p>
												Over the many years that we have had computers, our
												safety has had to evolve with it. Back in the old days,
												before internet banking, social media, online gaming,
												etc., people did not have much to worry about. However,
												there were still malicious programs and people out on
												the World Wide Web, but there was less of a worry of
												people getting their information stolen from the
												internet. The first known computer virus was a worm
												named Creeper which would display a message saying “I’m
												the creeper: catch me If you can!” created by Bob Thomas
												in 1971. It was put onto ARPANET (a network which was
												the foundation of the internet we know today<a href="#cybersecurity_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a>) to
												spread to different computers and self-duplicate, as
												Creeper duplicated itself, it would erase older versions
												of itself<a href="#cybersecurity_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>. In retaliation to this, Thomas’s friend
												wrote another program to delete any instance of Creeper
												appropriately named: Reaper. Thus making Reaper the
												first antivirus software.
											</p>
											<p>
												Later, in 1989, the “Morris Worm” started to spread,
												which was the first DoS (denial of service) attack to
												spread around the internet, which affected around 6,000
												computers. According to the creator of the Morris Worm;
												Robert Morris. It was designed to determine just how big
												the internet was, although what the worm would do was
												infect the same computer over and over thus slowing it
												down to the point of crashing. To rid the world of the
												Morris Worm, regional networks had to be disconnected
												for several days, shutting down the entire internet.
												From this, teams were created to tackle these kinds of
												issues; these teams were called Computer Emergency
												Response Teams, or CERTs for short.<a href="#cybersecurity_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>
											</p>
											<p>
												Then came the 90s, all new exciting technology! Easily
												accessible by the public, Tamagotchi’s for the kids!
												Phones which were inside of cars! Super HD realistic
												amazing graphics in video games! And the most exciting,
												VIRUSES! Anyone could upload anything, so why not upload
												viruses? They started primarily as pranks pulled by
												internet trolls, but later expanded into more complex
												infections, like trojans, spyware and malware.
												Unfortunately, CERTs couldn’t do a lot, yes they would
												fight the viruses, but they were just a response team.
												They could react and deal with the emergency when it
												came to be but could not prevent the outbreak from
												occurring. Because of this, antivirus software entered
												the field, which would fight the viruses, and save
												peoples data.<a href="#cybersecurity_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>
											</p>
											<p>
												Coming to now, we have cyber-attacks have drastically
												evolved. Cybercriminals are coming up with more
												malicious, creative, and challenging ways to obtain
												peoples data and ruin people’s lives. This comes to the
												question, what is the new state of the art technology
												regarding cybersecurity? Antimalware companies such as
												Symantec are using Artificial Intelligence and Machine
												Learning to “… analyse all of the data running into or
												out of an organisation to determine where the
												vulnerabilities of those systems lie.” <a href="#cybersecurity_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> AI and
												Machine Learning can analyse data collected from
												millions of different incidents and utilise this
												knowledge to identify potential threats.
												Network-monitoring tools can also be used (which utilise
												AI) to gather the daily behaviour of users, and analyse
												the information collected to smoke out anything
												malicious, whether it be a program downloaded on the
												computer or a link someone clicked on in an email. Thus,
												making it harder for hostile threats to harm devices.<a href="#cybersecurity_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a>
											</p>
											<p>
												However, this does not mean people cannot steal your
												information or data; it just makes it harder for harmful
												programs to access your data. Unfortunately, people can
												still steal your details from social media sites such as
												Facebook, or Instagram, and they can take information
												from your mailbox or mail which was thrown in the
												rubbish. They can download photos, take your name, and
												pretty much steal your identity. With the correct safety
												measures, this can be prevented, by privatising your
												profiles, limiting the amount of information uploaded
												onto these sites, putting a lock on your mailbox, and
												disposing of mail thoroughly.
											</p>
											<p>
												According to Microsofts CYBERSPACE 2025: Today’s
												Decisions, Tomorrow’s Terrain there are three future
												scenarios as to what is going to happen. The first being
												Plateau which predicts that some countries can advance
												economically and socioeconomically with the use of
												technology, while others are left behind, causing a very
												uneven terrain for cybersecurity. The second Peak, which
												is when governments collaborate to promote strong open
												trades. In this scenario, businesses, governments and
												other organisations encourage the widespread use of
												technology, resulting in the accelerated growth of
												improved cybersecurity. The third scenario is Canyon,
												which has a limited use of ICT, causing none-to-slow
												growth of cybersecurity, due to the isolation, and
												obstructionist government policies, restricting trade
												amongst others and lessening economic and socioeconomic
												relationships with other countries. <a href="#cybersecurity_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a>
											</p>
											<p>
												The most likely scenario out of these three is Plateau.
												Primarily because, some countries have been struggling
												to advance technologically, and this will continue for
												at least another decade. However, the world will be
												trying to push towards the Peak scenario; I do not think
												that the Peak outcome will occur for a while.
											</p>
											<p>
												This would create more jobs in the cybersecurity sector,
												and in IT in general. With the significant demand for
												cybersecurity professionals at the moment, it means that
												if by 2025, the Plateau scenario or the Peak scenario
												occurs, there will be a more significant demand for
												cybersecurity professionals.
											</p>

											<h4>How will this affect you?</h4>
											<p>
												Every day I use my computer, smartphone, smartwatch, car
												head-unit, and online banking. All of my information
												like my name, phone number, address, etc., is accessible
												on all of these, with the correct safety measures such
												as; restricting what I upload, keeping my data as
												private as I can, and using antimalware programs, I have
