									<h3 class="major">Group Reflection</h3>
									<p>
										The consensus among “Meme-Team” members is that everyone got
										along really well. We all believed we became good friends,
										which lead to a great group dynamic and team chemistry.
										Michael noted that the group understood when we had time for
										“fun and games,” and when we knew we had to focus on the
										task at hand. Thomas believed as a group, we would actively
										communicate with each other whilst having a solid
										understanding of each other’s skillsets, which made it easy
										to delegate out tasks. Everyone seemed to have a similar
										understanding that we all had personal lives and commitments
										we had to attend outside of this project. We all
										communicated well and put things out to a group vote of when
										we could organize meetings and complete tasks.
									</p>
									<p>
										We all noted that improvement had to be made in group
										meetings in the future, particularly not going off-topic.
										Brent explained that a clear agenda or detailed list of
										upcoming tasks could have been made beforehand, with further
										discussion focused on that rather than filling the required
										times with general chat. Although having a professional
										image in the workplace is a valuable asset, according to
										Leonard’s opinion, our relaxed nature in team meetings
										allowed us to function better.
									</p>
									<p>
										It was stated through multiple reflections that such high
										levels of communication in our first project together were
										surprising. This, in turn, allowed for a better
										understanding of each other’s strengths and weaknesses and
										worked fittingly around them. Thomas, who generally finds it
										difficult to work in team environments, was surprised by how
										well the team allowed him time and respect to input his
										information.  Brent said that he was surprised how well the
										Meme-Team got along so well, which Lochlann reiterated by
										claiming we worked well without any disputes, personal
										clashes, or arguments.
									</p>
									<p>
										Overall, we learned that group dynamics vary greatly between
										team members. Steven explained that it was challenging to
										organize different tasks and roles as a group. People have
										different opinions, different skillsets, lives, and
										commitments outside of the project. There will always be
										unforeseen circumstances that arise during unexpected times,
										and he stated that each person has their own unique way of
										dealing with these problems. Brent’s opinion was that equal
										contribution toward the assignment was impossible and that
										certain members carried a greater output over the course of
										the assignment. It is not that this is a bad thing or that
										anyone was holding the group back, as all workplaces have
										employees who naturally accomplish a big workload. He said
										that to remain level headed, he would focus on what he could
										do as an individual to contribute to the team, rather than
										worrying about what anyone else was contributing.
									</p>
									<p>
										The Meme-Team's collaboration via Github worked very well
										for us. Steve had the greatest contributions as he was the
										predominant coder of our group. Brent uploaded many meeting
										minutes, so Github's contributions were slightly exaggerated
										as Github measures of Lines contributed rather than Words.
										This platform allowed us to access different forms and files
										when working together easily, making building the website
										easy to copy/paste snippets of information. While the
										contributor's page on Github is a handy feature, it doesn't
										fully show the team's whole contributions behind the scenes.
										The graph contribution information doesn't represent time
										and research put into the information uploaded.
									</p>
									<p>
										In summary, each team member was definitely happy with the
										overall results of the project. We all had a great time
										working with each other. However, it was stressful; we still
										managed to keep things together, stay focused, and have fun
										achieving a great finished outcome.
									</p>

												Overall, I am very pleased with assignment 2. Outside of
												a few personal commitments that team members have needed
												to attend, all meetings have had full attendance, have
												been very punctual and we have met all our required
												dates.
											</p>
											<p>
												I feel the agenda for each meeting could have been
												improved upon. As soon as we finished discussion on the
												required topics, we were essentially filling in the
												minimum required time by chatting for the rest of the
												meeting. A more detailed list of tasks is required in
												the future.
											</p>
											<p>
												I was surprised by how well our group got along. A team
												project rarely coheres perfectly together; however, ours
												seemed to do so. Everyone was very understanding about
												the needs of personal commitments and the flexibility
												required to work around that. After every meeting, team
												members would sit around and chat about the uni course,
												the assignment, gaming, and plenty of other things.
											</p>
											<p>
												What I learned is that it is impossible for each member
												to contribute an equal amount in a team environment.
												Whilst our group definitely did not have any slackers
												per se, I felt a couple of team members carried a huge
												output over the course of the assignment. In a perfect
												world, everyone would contribute the same; however, in
												almost all workplaces I have been involved in, there are
												definitely people who naturally achieve more than
												others. I found the important thing is not to stress
												what others have (or have not) done and focus on what I
												can do to help the team.
											</p>
											<p>
												Our Github activity has been a really positive asset to
												our project. Each member has made outstanding
												contributions toward it, in particular our Coders.
												Although I am not in the coding part of our team, I
												imagine GitHub made their roles much easier.

												This team works very well together, and I think it
												shows, everyone pulled their weight and the group
												dynamic is a testament to how quickly strangers can get
												to know each other when they have similar interests and
												a fun attitude which the ‘Meme Team’ definitely has.
												Each team member had a healthy amount of urgency, a
												great deal of communication (multiple times a day inside
												and outside of Microsoft Teams), and often put in
												humorous enterprising effort, quite surprisingly, this
												is exactly the team that fits with my personal profile.
											</p>
											<p>
												As the team name suggests, a downside to our group of
												individuals is our ability to ‘meme’ or joke around.
												Many times, we would joke around or discuss group work
												outside of meetings and RMIT approved platforms, but
												often during a recorded ‘Teams’ call we would get
												side-tracked and distracted. If something were to be
												improved it would be our ‘professional image’, though it
												is my opinion we function better with the relaxed nature
												that’s created otherwise. working in a group allows us
												all to take on different workloads, simultaneously
												helping each other and returning the favour, I did not
												know I would be interested in going to team meetings,
												but I learnt that groups can become something to look
												forward to with the right people.

												I feel as though the team has had an outstanding dynamic
												throughout the course of assignment 2. We all attended
												every meeting on time, and if not, we would let our team
												members know well in advance. We would stay on topic as
												close as possible, although we could have done better in
												this regard. At times, it did become rather
												unprofessional with the off-topic chat; however, I think
												that was more a reflection of how well we got along
												working with each other. I felt very comfortable with
												everyone, and there has been a tremendous amount of
												support between all of us. Tasks have been completed on
												time.
											</p>
											<p>
												All of us would communicate as to when we could finish
												our tasks, and if we could not, we would let the other
												team members know. All of the meetings were planned
												around each other's schedules. There were no clashes
												between anybody. We set-up our team, Meme Team, within
												the first week or so, allowing us plenty of time to get
												to know everyone and figure out how we could help each
												other.

												In my reflection of our assignment 2 group, I feel we
												gelled very well with each other. We had a good
												understanding of when there was a time for fun and games
												and when we had to be serious and focus on the tasks at
												the end.
											</p>
											<p>
												Although a positive aspect of our meetings was high
												attendance and punctuality, we lacked a clear agenda and
												seemed to get sidetracked quite easily. In saying that,
												this was only our first team assignment together, and it
												was a massive learning experience for all of us. A
												positive outcome through this is that we got to know
												each other well and become friends, which, in turn, will
												lead to better results when it comes to working together
												again in the future. I have learned that in group
												settings, there is a requirement to understand everyone
												and where they are coming from and understand that their
												views on certain situations will likely differ from
												mine. I feel GitHub has helped track our uploads but not
												what we have done off-site say editing files and
												research away from the site.

												Overall as a team, I believe we worked together rather well. I felt we all got along, were productive with our meetings, and showed
												that we could organise together and willing to take on tasks. All team members were willing to work together to get things done.
												There is always room for improvement, though.
											</p>
											<p>
												While everyone had a presence in the meetings and the attendance was high, the meetings could definitely be more organised with a
												clearer focus of what we wish to discuss before going into them. Some meetings did get side-tracked and go off-topic, but I also was
												surprised that the communication between us was high and allowed us to get to know each other better along with each other’s strengths
												and weaknesses, which can be really difficult to establish such a friendship in a team environment.
											</p>
											<p>
												I have learned that it can also be difficult to organise as a group. Everyone has lives outside of the group and can have unforeseen
												issues that occur outside of work/study. Everyone also has their own preferred style of accomplishing things. Proper planning and
												communication can help to mitigate these issues.

											<p>
												For me, our group, The Meme Team, was particularly
												fluent when given specific direction or requirements and
												would actively communicate and collaborate to delegate
												issues to those who can solve them.
											</p>
											<p>
												We had a good understanding of each other's unique
												skillsets, which we would then willingly workaround,
												increasing the overall productivity. We had amazing
												flexibility as a team, which was necessary when knowing
												that each member has different commitments outside of
												study and also being from multiple different timezones.
												I found that the group dynamic and rapid ability to
												solve arising conflicts were extremely good, and we
												would resolve any issues within the current meeting or a
												sufficient frame of time in a polite and often humorous
												manner while still remaining productive.
											</p>
											<p>
												I found it very enjoyable and was amazed to be able to
												maintain a playful mood among my group members and still
												pertain to a constructive atmosphere, stay focused on
												the task at hand but still having fun with the work
												given. Generally, I find it a struggle to work with
												others, in particular in getting my point of information
												across efficiently and found that in this case, I was
												given acquit time and respect to get through our
												meetings appropriately.
											</p>
											<p>
												In retrospect, I am quite satisfied with our team's
												overall efforts, especially through the use of GitHub,
												which made life easy from a collaborative aspect. I look
												forward to our group's next assignment and any possible
												future work with my companions at hand.
