										The Meme Team had an interview with a Junior Systems Admin
										for a US based company, who gave use a useful insight into
										his daily life and the technology around him, from cloud
										services, servers and how he started his career in the IT
										field.
									</p>
									<p>
										Below is the full transcript from that interview.

									<h3 class="major">Interview Transcript</h3>

									<h4>Brent</h4>
									<p>
										Alright John, welcome mate, we are the Meme Team, we're
										studying at RMIT university. Thanks for joining us and
										thanks for being an interviewee candidate.
									</p>
									<p>
										First off, do you want to introduce yourself mate, tell us
										who you are, where you’re from, what you do?
									</p>
									<h4>John</h4>
									<p>
										Yeah, no problem. So, my name is John, been working as a
										junior systems admin for a little over a year and a half
										now. So basically, the company I work for is an MSP, a
										managed service provider so companies contract my company to
										basically be their hands-on IT company. So, whether it's you
										know software is not working something like hardware wise
										isn't working or what have you, they call us up and we
										basically kind of go to bat for them so yeah.
									</p>
									<h4>Brent</h4>
									<p>
										What are some of the most common problems within your field?
									</p>
									<h4>John</h4>
									<p>
										User error. I would say 90% of the stuff is going to be user
										error, No. Honestly it's gonna be big patches, like when
										Windows, Microsoft, when somebody does patching through OS
										or software. I know like right away I think like right when
										I started they were trying to make Microsoft was making the
										transition from Skype for business to Teams and like,
										nobody, Teams were so bad like, in its early form so a lot
										of people are having issues with that. So, I would say day
										to day it's going to be typically like you know. Basically,
										from the customer's point of view, it's going to be, you
										know, yesterday it was working, but today it's not. Why?
										What is that? So, it's lot of troubleshooting, a lot of
										repetition. I do a lot of server work, server maintenances,
										deployment, stuff like that. Do network migration, like a
										company will move into a new office, so move their entire
										server and their entire network, all the workstations,
										everything. Yeah, UAP’s, wireless access point. Stuff like
										that, and we move it all to a new building. So it really
										keeps me busy. there's a lot of different stuff to do so no
										two days are the same for sure.
									</p>
									<h4>Brent</h4>
									<p>
										Yeah for sure. What’s the most rewarding part about your
										job?
									</p>
									<h4>John</h4>
									<p>
										Probably closing a ticket and saying I'm done with
										something. Most rewarding I, honestly, I like helping people
										like you know when someone comes in like hey like we got
										this crazy problem like, and you have to find a way to get
										from whatever their problem is you have to find a way to get
										to a solution. So you know it's it might take you know 1/2
										hour. It might take a couple days, might be a long ***
										project. Sorry. it might be a long project that goes, you
										know it starts off is one thing and all of a sudden like OK,
										well then, we're going to get this, had to buy one of these
										you know. Not to get too specific but things can evolve and
										it's like at the end it's just like that sense of
										accomplishment like you help somebody, you know, and
										especially when it's like, even like a small team you know
										they're just trying to do their jobs and you help make
										people get paid to do their jobs. It's good stuff.
									</p>
									<h4>Brent</h4>
									<p>
										That’s what you want. Thanks for that mate. So, Michael?
									</p>
									<h4>Michael</h4>
									<p>
										Good day John, how you going? Is it working now?
									</p>
									<h4>John</h4>
									<p>Yeah</p>
									<h4>Michael</h4>
									<p>
										Cool. Obviously just got a few questions of me to ask here,
										but, during your studies, did you find a particular field
										that grabbed your attention more than one of the others, say
										like game development, web development, or IT solutions
										moving forward in that field of study.
									</p>
									<h4>John</h4>
									<p>
										So full transparency, I did not go to school for IT. I
										started as like an intern basically. So it was kind of a who
										you know, kind of thing. My fiancé was working and that
										actually the company that hired me was their IT people, so
										they found out what I had been doing. Just you know what I
										what I've been doing. I've built a lot of computers. I've
										done a lot of networking stuff for my parents in my own
										home. You know, I did a couple skills tests and they were
										really impressed. They brought me on as an intern, so I
										started out just doing answering phones and just fixing
										computers that people brought into the shop and a year and a
										half later, I'm doing a bunch of service stuff, I'm working
										with like gold managed customers for whatever issues they
										have. So Full disclosure, no schooling man. It just kind of
										seeing where the path takes me, but right now it's like, you
										know, now it's handling like the higher tier customers and
										their daily needs, and also onboarding new clients too. and
										that's my favourite part actually, 'cause you know you
										inherit some people's crappy network and then you have to
										make it work for them, You know, so that's kind of that's
										kind of fulfilling.
									</p>
									<h4>Michael</h4>
									<p>
										Sounds fun, sounds fun. So in the current field, obviously
										you said your favourite parts, obviously, making people's
										networks work, but what would be the most challenging along
										the path you've gone in relation to daily basis and having
										to learn new stuff?
									</p>
									<h4>John</h4>
									<p>
										The hardest part is probably that initial email or phone
										call or whatever, like the hardest, is probably on site like
										hey, why doesn’t this work? You don't have time to Google,
										you don’t have time to ask, they're asking you straight up
										face to face like why is this not working? That's probably
										one of the most challenging things, but like day to day it's
										probably you fixing something and the client breaking it
										again. Swear to God it happens weekly man. I just spent
										hours fixing this and you guys broke it again. I don't know
										how, but it's, you know, it's a lot of repetition.
										Eventually down the road it's like oh actually I remember
										doing this and this, so it makes it a lot easier. But yeah,
										user error and operator error is definitely, probably the
										most taxing annoying thing for sure.
									</p>
									<h4>Michael</h4>
									<p>
										I can understand that. In your current line, do you use any
										cloud services? And if you do, what cloud services do you
										use?
									</p>
									<h4>John</h4>
									<p>
										Um, so actually our company as it is, we don't, I mean, we
										have our own cloud backups, but the only thing that really
										worry about is Azure probably and just mostly, it's just
										troubleshooting it for other people like a lot of people
										their switching. Drop box is huge, ever since everyone
										started working remote. You know, Dropbox, One Drive, Google
										Drive all that kind of stuff is huge now so a lot of people
										they just kind of said here, figure this out and so we had
										to kind of walk them through it. I mean I've used Google
										Drive but I had to learn Dropbox, One Drive, Azure, all that
										kind of stuff. You can learn on the fly, but it takes a
										little bit for sure.
									</p>
									<h4>Michael</h4>
									<p>
										That probably it for me. I had one more question, but it was
										more going down where you feel cloud services would be
										going, but as you said, you don't really use them in your
										current field at the moment, so I'll pass it over to Leo.
									</p>
									<h4>Leonard</h4>
									<p>
										Hi, hey John. You said you didn't go to school, but my
										question was about if you had an IT goal, career goal and I
										was thinking more in line of if you're in school what you're
										aiming towards but say when you first started in the IT
										field, what would you say was your career goal if you had
										one?
									</p>
									<h4>John</h4>
									<p>
										I think it would definitely be along the lines of like the
										network migration and set up, a server deployment. That kind
										of thing because that's like the nuts and bolts of a network
										to be able to lay the groundwork for that and starting
										literally with just like a blank server, and making, it's
										basically just the canvas like you can make everything in
										like filling out a whole Active Directory, getting all the
										raids setup for backups and everything like, just starting
										from scratch and literally just building from the ground up,
										I really enjoy doing that. The network migration, like it's
										very tedious and you actually have to obviously make sure
										everything is right as it was before so that everything is
										working once they get to the new office location. But that's
										probably my favourite, It’s probably the server deployment
										and network migration and setups.
									</p>
									<h4>Leonard</h4>
									<p>
										Is that like the physical part of it?
									</p>
									<h4>John</h4>
									<p>
										Yeah, that's literally like, you have the wire rack and
										everything you know you got all the different switches and
										it's like well you got all these computers how you going to
										get Internet so you have to work with the different people
										as the buildings being constructed. Like the electricians
										and networking guys, cable guys, you're working with
										everybody and you're making you know that whole office
										building have their network. So it's definitely not for
										everybody, but it's pretty interesting to me, Yeah.
									</p>
									<h4>Leonard</h4>
									<p>
										And just my other question was, have you found yourself
										moving into different IT fields than you had originally set
										as your goal? But I think you've kind of stayed in kind of
										the same field, right?
									</p>
									<h4>John</h4>
									<p>
										Yeah, I think the only thing that's really changed that I
										really wasn't expecting is, just because everyone was
										working from home and I'm in the US, which I didn't say
										that, so we are coronavirus ground zero. So everyone is
										working from home, so we had to do all this on site work but
										we weren't allowed to go onto sites for a long time so we
										had to learn how to do things that we did in person remotely
										with people who didn't know how to do that, which was
										really, really difficult. But so we’ve actually switched to
										where we are about probably 5050 now between remote work and
										physical on site, so that's a little bit different, because
										you know, it's easy just to go in and do something for
										somebody, you know. But having to walk them through
										something like, if you don't have Internet how are you
										supposed to remote in. So, you literally have to walk them
										through something like on the phone, and that was, yeah.
									</p>
									<h4>Leonard</h4>
									<p>
										Oh wow, difficult, right. Yeah, OK that was my questions
										thanks. I'll pass it on to Steven now.
									</p>
									<h4>Steven</h4>
									<p>
										Hi John, nice to meet you. So my questions are more based
										around the future of your career. First one would be is
										there any technologies, they may be ones that are in
										development or ones that you could foresee that you think
										could help enhance your job currently?
									</p>
									<h4>John</h4>
									<p>
										Yeah, and actually this is something that we just went
										through. So, we just on boarded a very, very large client, I
										think they have about 120 workstations, 2 servers and just
										tons and tons of other fun things. They have a lot of people
										that travel a lot, so they have tablets that are part of the
										network and all that kind of crap. So basically, they were
										with another IT company and they switched over to us and you
										would think that a lot of this stuff is pretty easy to
										transition but for some reason or another there's no easy
										way to switch. Even like pulling antivirus’s off, like you
										have to run like PowerShell commands and **** like that.
										Sorry. And it's just, removing software from one company and
										transitioning to another, which it happens a lot like you
										know what like, times are tough, people can't afford one
										company, or they can't afford us, so they're going to
										somebody else. So people are trying to actively find, you
										know, room for IT in their budget because you have to have
										it. People can't work remotely without IT support. But when
										we were on boarding this client like it was just so
										difficult to kind of just get everybody’s software from the
										other company off and getting everything from our company on
										there at least as far as like remote access, antivirus,
										stuff like that. The different software that we have just
										attracts like, OK, this computer hasn't been on-line like
										what's going on with it, it has diagnostics, it has all the
										hardware stats and stuff like that. It sounds really boring,
										I know that some of the IT stuff is not as exciting as I
										know you guys will think about like app development,
										software development, but yeah. That's just something that
										If we could find a nice way to transition all that stuff,
										that would be that would be the dream for me.
									</p>
									<h4>Steven</h4>
									<p>
										Yeah, well it sounds tough. So, this is a sort of typical
										job interview question I guess, but I'll go there anyway. Do
										you see yourself in the same career path in five years? Same
										line of work.
									</p>
									<h4>John</h4>
									<p>
										Uh, I'd stay in IT, but at the same time, like, I know that
										just because people's needs are evolving too, like
										companies, I think, probably 80% of our clients right now
										are still working remotely. I mean 'cause still a lot of the
										US is still shut down, I don't know how much you guys pay
										attention in the news, but I mean it's still a lot of people
										that are still working from home. But I think just because
										more people are relying on their computers, now more than
										ever, I think I ideally in 5 years, I would probably want to
										be more into like the client acquisition kind of thing like
										getting more people to sign up with our company like you
										know that's kind of the, maybe the people person in me, like
										I enjoy working and helping people so that would probably be
										something that's more tailored towards my own personality
										and my own interests.
									</p>
									<h4>Steven</h4>
									<p>
										Well, thank you for your answers. I'll pass you off to
										Thomas.
									</p>
									<h4>Thomas</h4>
									<p>
										Hello John.
									</p>
									<h4>John</h4>
									<p>
										Hey Tom.
									</p>
									<h4>Thomas</h4>
									<p>
										Generalized questions, as everyone else has thrown at you.
										Did you have a type of technology or a person within your
										field of IT that inspired you towards it? Or is it simply
										something that you felt the need to do? Is it like, yeah,
										how are you driven by this?
									</p>
									<h4>John</h4>
									<p>
										I think it's just, it starts out really simple like the
										first few computers I built, maybe about 10 years ago. It
										just starts as something simple, something basic and just
										seeing, kind of, you know, everyone's like, oh, how did you
										do that? It's like it's really not that hard like it's
										actually kind of fun. I enjoyed it, just troubleshooting.
										I've always liked the critical thinking, problem solving,
										and stuff and it actually was one of my high school
										teachers, actually, we wrote our own website in HTML code,
										like by hand. And just doing that and that is actually the
										same, coincidentally the same time when they built the
										computer, I think from then I was always kind of interested.
										And then I got an opportunity with this company and I've
										just kind of honed it sense. But yeah, I think we're writing
										that first website with the, back like I think in my Senior
										High School, it was is really exciting. I mean I never ended
										up going into coding, but that's kind of the first. I was
										like, wow, I like this. This is real stuff, this is going to
										be big.
									</p>
									<h4>Thomas</h4>
									<p>
										Yeah, that's really cool dude. Beyond that, is there any
										specified skills, you mentioned coding and critical thinking
										and that, do you find any specific skills of prevalent
										within your day-to-day work that you would find a necessity
										to IT work.
									</p>
									<h4>John</h4>
									<p>
										Patience. Patience, number 1 hands down. I think just being
										able to think objectively, because you're going to be
										presented with problems, you're going to be handed info that
										may be incomplete or incorrect. People might say like hey, I
										don't think my motherboards working, it’s like no you just
										unseated your RAM dumb, dumb. You have to take everything
										people say with a grain of salt that it's going to be,
										basically, one of my bosses actually even said, like when
										someone calls and gives you an issue, just assume that
										they're lying. Just try to figure it out, think objectively
										and just try to start with your point A and just kind of
										troubleshoot and working through that. And then, I mean,
										once you do that kind of stuff for a while, I mean it's
										just, you start, your mind just starts like the person still
										describing the issue, or like describing the problem and
										you're already kind of working through it. It's like, OK,
										well, it can't be the router, you know your kind of working
										through, OK, OK, well maybe you know. you just keep kind of
										thinking of different scenarios and I mean that honestly,
										just constantly being patient and understanding people and
										then also just you know, being willing to troubleshoot and
										be wrong.
									</p>
									<h4>Thomas</h4>
									<p>
										Really, that's awesome. Yeah, I found that really
										insightful. Thank you. I'm gonna pass you over to Lochie
										now. Thank you for your time.
									</p>
									<h4>Lochlann</h4>
									<p>
										Hey man, so what I want to know, do you have any IT projects
										which you want to work towards? Whether it's like for a
										career or for personal reasons that you've kind of been able
										to work towards in your current job? Sorry if that doesn't
										make any sense.
									</p>
									<h4>John</h4>
									<p>
										Ah, like projects within, like that I'm doing for companies
										or stuff that I'm doing personally or what are you thinking
										here?
									</p>
									<h4>Lochlann</h4>
									<p>
										Well, either way, like for companies or just personally
										like, say if, like I don't know you're setting up like a
										personal server for yourself or something like that, like at
										home, or anything like that, that has helped your career.
									</p>
									<h4>John</h4>
									<p>
										So, the owner of my company and the manager I report to,
										they both have their own media servers at home, so they each
										have their own dedicated Plex server. So, they have their
										own network, and they have like, simply to say, that's
										probably one of the perks. Like I think this was one of
										Brents questions that he was kind of showing me. It's like
										one of the perks. You have access to software; you have
										access to hardware. You've got access to things that most
										people probably don't, and I mean it's obviously, for most
										of us, either really cheap or for free. So, I actually did
										pick up a server about a week ago and I've been kind of
										working it just to just to kind of customize it for my own
										house. So yeah, that's weird that you ask that.
									</p>
									<h4>Lochlann</h4>
									<p>
										And also, what was the hardest point in your career and how
										did you overcome it?
									</p>
									<h4>John</h4>
									<p>
										Hardest point, hardest point. OK, so this, I don't know how
										much you guys work with like servers and live networks, but
										we had one of our bigger clients right downtown here in the
										city and we basically, long story short, we had to unplug
										their server. And we had about like 40 seconds to do what we
										needed to do before we had to plug it back in and just
										knowing that their whole network, while they're still
										working, we had to make this switch over from the old server
										to the new server. And then just not having this amount of
										time like, it was just a lot of pressure. And you know that
										it's like everything is kind of riding on that, and I was by
										myself. So, I mean, yeah, there's situations like that where
										you know, like you're working with somebody, especially if
										it's a larger company, there's a lot at stake, whether it be
										time being a factor or if you break their stuff, like you
										are held accountable. So, it's just kind of having those
										kind of pressure situations and I mean, it would be cliche
										to say don't let it get to you, but it's gonna get you. But
										just get the job done and do it right.
									</p>
									<h4>Lochlann</h4>
									<p>
										Sounds rough. That was the only two that I had. I’ll pass it
										back to Brent
									</p>
									<h4>Brent</h4>
									<p>
										Yeah, well on behalf of the Meme Team. We would like to
										thank you for joining us. Even just in joining us, you
										obviously displayed your position as a systems admin pretty
										well by troubleshooting our call problem.
									</p>
									<h4>John</h4>
									<p>
										If you want one piece of advice, no matter what field you’re
										in, if something is not working, turn it off and turn it
										back on. It sounds so stupid, it's so cliche. I'm telling it
										will solve like 70% of your problems.
									</p>
									<h4>Brent</h4>
									<p>
										Yeah, well, we'll take that on advice on board. And yeah, we
										appreciate your time with us. It's been good mate. It's been
										really insightful and yeah, hopefully it will go a long way
										to helping us learn and do well in this uni course. So,
										thank you very much. We appreciate it.
									</p>
									<h4>John</h4>
									<p>
										Goodluck guys, take it easy.
