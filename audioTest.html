							<p>
								The scope of the project is relative to the considered
								finalization stage based off time restraints given as well
								individual commitments that may impede progress of the final
								outcome. Given the current assignment deadline as it stands,
								we have a prototype of our entertainment system that presents
								the functionality of recording raw audio inputs and said input
								recorded logged as an actively saved sound file. Along with
								this is a 3rd dimensional digital visual representation as
								designs for the product, as well place holder for a voice over
								for the game.
							</p>
							<p>
								As the scope for a whole development cycle is unfeasible give
								our current restrictions it would be appropriate to assume
								that the game loop the system requires for basic function may
								not be presentable and delivered in segments as
								aforementioned.

								These would pertain to the basic game functions such as taking
								the audio and saving it as a file but will not be yet able to
								compare these audio files accurately or to an acquitted
								standard of function that a final output would need, as well
								as deliverable or a real-world demonstration of our final
								product would be un-producible. Although, many examples of
								code and hardware needed to function have been explored by
								multiple members of the Meme Team with drawn and computer
								drawn designs as well as working on a Raspberry Pi that is
								recording audio input which can be seen in the protect
								testing. Extensive research has also been put towards the
								absent necessity through the subset tasks proposed by the Mimi
								Box although this achievement may be unobtainable due to the
								hypothetical global appeal of the device and vigorous testing
								that is implied by a global scale production line that is also
								mentioned in the testing section, an example that could be
								given upon the long term that would not happen without backing
								from a company or entrepreneur.
							</p>
							<p>
								As the game is sound based it wouldn't be illogical to draw
								comparison towards Sony Entertainments Sing-Star<a
								href="#scope_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> in which you try to imitate
								famous singers in iconic songs and although on January 31,
								2020 the company shut down, the proportions of the company
								speak for themselves and in the case of long-term development
								would see them as a milestone competitor "Sing-Star series has
								now sold over 20 million units, Sony has announced....
								confirmed 16 million units had been sold across PAL regions
								alone"<a href="#scope_2"><sup>[2]</a>. This connects back to
								the global variation required by the testing and a final
								production line and would be considered way beyond the scope
								of current circumstances.
