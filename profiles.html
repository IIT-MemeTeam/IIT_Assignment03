									<p>
										We are a team of 6 guys who simply just love memes, hence
										the "Meme-Team"! We enjoy talking in "meme language" in
										various different I.T chats and that's how we found each
										other. While we understand we occasionally tend to irritate
										others with the way we talk, this passion for memeing brings
										us enjoyment and creates team chemistry for us.
									</p>
									<p>Meme-team requirements? Always meme.</p>

											<h3 class="major">About Me</h3>
											<p>
												I am a 30-year-old male from Melbourne, Australia. I
												completed VCE in 2008 and have since worked in various
												roles within the Railway and Civil industries. When I
												was 5 years old, I received a NES for Christmas with the
												Super Mario Bros. 1 and 2. From there on, I played a
												wide array of games before eventually deciding to build
												my own computer many years later. This is where my
												interest in the field of Information Technology began...
											</p>

											<p>
												I am extremely passionate about Football and Basketball,
												being a major Saints and Celtics fan respectively
												outside of gaming and computers. I also love fishing,
												camping, and escaping the hustle and bustle of the city
												to explore our beautiful country.
											</p>

											<h3 class="major">About Me</h3>
											<p>
											 I am a 28 Male Australian. When I was in primary
											 school, I had no idea why my brothers friend could play
											 NES roms on his computer while they wouldn’t work on
											 our macintosh, from this starting point my interest in
											 IT and all its workings would manifest. Classmates in
											 my country side high-school were impressed by the small
											 scripts i could write, and as I moved forward my
											 interest developed my skills in problem solving, video
											 editing, and just enough of everything else to play
											 around with at beginner level. I’d like to work on game
											 mechanics, design and video editing in my spare time,
											 and I believe that the skills I learn from working with
											 our group ‘Meme Team’ will benefit me both in the
											 course and my hobbies
										 	</p>

											<h3 class="major">Career Plans</h3>
											<h4>Outcome</h4>
											<p>

												</li>
												<li>
													Study 3D modelling and programming software from
													professional tutorials from lynda.com, skillshare,
													udemy (to name a few) to develop my interest and
													solidify my ideal career plan.
												</li>
												<li>
													Position myself to develop team building and

											<h3 class="major">About Me</h3>
											<p>
												My nickname is Lo and I live in Queensland with my
												fiancee. I spend alot of my free time gaming, and
												chilling out. I used to have a dream of setting up an
												American styled 50's diner. But this dream got crushed
												when I realised I do not like working in Hospitality. So
												I decided to change my dream to something involving my
												hobbies; IT. I have been mucking around with computers
												ever since I was a very young child, I was always
												getting new technology, breaking it, troubleshooting
												what I did, and then fixing it all up again.
											</p>

											<h3 class="major">Career Plans</h3>

											<h4>Outcome</h4>
											<p>
												My dream career has changed since Assignment 1 and
												Assignment 2. I aim to get a career in the cybersecurity
												field as a Cybersecurity Consultant. I got this
												motivation after completing the Cybersecurity research
												task for Assignment 2. While conducting the research, I
												discovered the importance of keeping yourself safe
												online and in the real world. I would love to assess and
												advise people on how they can keep their personal
												information and data safe.
											</p>

											<h4>Short Term Goal (0 – 1 year) </h4>
											<p>
												Within the next year, I would like to continue studying
												Bachelor of Information Technology through RMIT. While
												attending, I would like to make friends in the IT field
												and get in contact with people who are already in the
												field, preferably Cybersecurity Consultants, but also
												people who would like to get into the area as well.
											</p>

											<h4>Mid Term Goal (1 – 5 years)</h4>
											<p>
												Within the next five years, I would like to complete my
												Bachelor of Information Technology and start applying to
												IT jobs in my area (South-East Queensland). I hope to
												gain some experience within the Cybersecurity area, to
												do this I will enquire with companies, friends, and
												family to see if anyone is willing to give me work
												experience or to let me shadow a team to see what goes
												on.
											</p>

											<h4>Long Term Goal ( > 5 years)</h4>
											<p>
												My long term goal is to become a Consultant, so I can
												help companies and individuals to become more cyber
												safe. I would also like to start my own small company of
												consultants, and in the future, expand into more fields.
											</p>

											<h4>Obstacles</h4>
											<p>
												I am not a hugely motivated person; I am pretty good at
												procrastinating; however, I aim to get over this
												obstacle so I can motivate myself to get into my ideal
												job. Currently, in the Sunshine Coast, there are not
												many options when it comes to a career in IT, this means
												that I am going to have to branch out and leave Sunshine
												Coast.
