										<p>
											We are a team of 6 guys who simply just love memes, hence
											the "Meme-Team"! We enjoy talking in "meme language" in
											various different I.T chats and that's how we found each
											other. While we understand we occasionally tend to irritate
											others with the way we talk, this passion for memeing brings
											us enjoyment and creates team chemistry for us.
										</p>
										<p>Meme-team requirements? Always meme.</p>

										<p>
											As seen from the table above, every team member of Meme Team
											has not changed their ideal job, except for Lochlann, who
											went from wanting to become a Field Technician to a
											Cybersecurity Consultant. Everybody in the team has one main
											goal that is the same; continue and complete studying
											Bachelor of Information Technologies at RMIT University.
											Every members ideal jobs requires lots of experience in
											programming.
										</p>

										<h3>Short Term Goals</h3>
										<p>
											All the team have similar short-term goals, primarily aiming
											towards continuing their studies through RMIT University.
											Every member is seeking to learn more about the different
											programming languages and concepts within the first year of
											getting to their goal. They will all also be conducting
											further research on the skills required for their dream
											jobs. Both Steven and Thomas will start learning about the
											program Unity and like Leonard, the game development
											process. Leonard will start participating in online game
											building challenges such as ‘Ludam Dare’ so he can gain a
											better understanding of his time management skills and his
											strengths and work towards achieving better team and
											leadership skills.
										</p>

										<h3>Mid Term Goals</h3>
										<p>
											There are a few similarities between the mid-term goals.
											Every member wishes to complete their Bachelor of IT, start
											searching for jobs in their respective field or similar
											areas, and further network with people in similar or the
											same fields. Brent will begin designing apps for his
											everyday use, further improving his programming and
											development skills. Leonard will start learning the language
											of the country he will eventually reside. Thomas will
											analyse metagames systems complications and formulate
											practical solutions, and Steven will start learning Unreal
											Engine.
										</p>

										<h3>Long Term Goals</h3>
										<p>
											All the members long term goals are vastly different;
											however, there are still some similarities. We all wish to
											continue networking with people in our desired industry and
											push to get a better understanding and further our knowledge
											in our field. Brent and Lochlann have the same idea of
											starting their own business. Michael wishes to begin
											learning Frameworks so he can master Front-End Development.
											Leonard will eventually apply for grants to produce
											educational IT projects. Thomas and Steven will start
											applying for senior positions.
										</p>
										<p>
											All of the career plans and end goals, although very
											different, have various similarities. Leonard and Thomas
											both wish to get into the gaming industry; Leonard as a
											Gameplay Engineer and Thomas as a Metagames System
											Programmer, which is vastly different to Michael who wishes
											to become a Front-End Web Developer. Brent and Steven also
											have similar dream careers; Brent wishes to become an
											Application Developer and Steven, a Software Developer.
											Although Brent wishes to become an Application Developer, he
											is also aiming towards starting his own business, like
											Lochlann. However, both companies will be very different.
											Lochlann will be starting up a company as a Cybersecurity
											Consultant, and Brents business will be focusing on general
											IT troubleshooting and maintenance.
										</p>
										<p>
											More information on each member of Meme Teams career plans
											can be found below.

												<h3 class="major">About Me</h3>
												<p>
													I am a 30-year-old male from Melbourne, Australia. I
													completed VCE in 2008 and have since worked in various
													roles within the Railway and Civil industries. When I
													was 5 years old, I received a NES for Christmas with the
													Super Mario Bros. 1 and 2. From there on, I played a
													wide array of games before eventually deciding to build
													my own computer many years later. This is where my
													interest in the field of Information Technology began...
												</p>

												<p>
													I am extremely passionate about Football and Basketball,
													being a major Saints and Celtics fan respectively
													outside of gaming and computers. I also love fishing,
													camping, and escaping the hustle and bustle of the city
													to explore our beautiful country.

												<h3 class="major">About Me</h3>
												<p>
												 I am a 28 Male Australian. When I was in primary
												 school, I had no idea why my brothers friend could play
												 NES roms on his computer while they wouldn’t work on
												 our macintosh, from this starting point my interest in
												 IT and all its workings would manifest. Classmates in
												 my country side high-school were impressed by the small
												 scripts i could write, and as I moved forward my
												 interest developed my skills in problem solving, video
												 editing, and just enough of everything else to play
												 around with at beginner level. I’d like to work on game
												 mechanics, design and video editing in my spare time,
												 and I believe that the skills I learn from working with

												<h3 class="major">About Me</h3>
												<p>
													My nickname is Lo and I live in Queensland with my
													fiancee. I spend alot of my free time gaming, and
													chilling out. I used to have a dream of setting up an
													American styled 50's diner. But this dream got crushed
													when I realised I do not like working in Hospitality. So
													I decided to change my dream to something involving my
													hobbies; IT. I have been mucking around with computers
													ever since I was a very young child, I was always
													getting new technology, breaking it, troubleshooting
													what I did, and then fixing it all up again.
												</p>

												<h3 class="major">Career Plans</h3>

												<h4>Outcome</h4>
												<p>
													My dream career has changed since Assignment 1 and
													Assignment 2. I aim to get a career in the cybersecurity
													field as a Cybersecurity Consultant. I got this
													motivation after completing the Cybersecurity research
													task for Assignment 2. While conducting the research, I
													discovered the importance of keeping yourself safe
													online and in the real world. I would love to assess and
													advise people on how they can keep their personal
													information and data safe.
												</p>

												<h4>Short Term Goal (0 – 1 year) </h4>
												<p>
													Within the next year, I would like to continue studying
													Bachelor of Information Technology through RMIT. While
													attending, I would like to make friends in the IT field
													and get in contact with people who are already in the
													field, preferably Cybersecurity Consultants, but also
													people who would like to get into the area as well.
												</p>

												<h4>Mid Term Goal (1 – 5 years)</h4>
												<p>
													Within the next five years, I would like to complete my
													Bachelor of Information Technology and start applying to
													IT jobs in my area (South-East Queensland). I hope to
													gain some experience within the Cybersecurity area, to
													do this I will enquire with companies, friends, and
													family to see if anyone is willing to give me work
													experience or to let me shadow a team to see what goes
													on.
												</p>

												<h4>Long Term Goal ( > 5 years)</h4>
												<p>
													My long term goal is to become a Consultant, so I can
													help companies and individuals to become more cyber
													safe. I would also like to start my own small company of
													consultants, and in the future, expand into more fields.
												</p>

												<h4>Obstacles</h4>
												<p>
													I am not a hugely motivated person; I am pretty good at
													procrastinating; however, I aim to get over this
													obstacle so I can motivate myself to get into my ideal
													job. Currently, in the Sunshine Coast, there are not
													many options when it comes to a career in IT, this means
													that I am going to have to branch out and leave Sunshine
													Coast.
